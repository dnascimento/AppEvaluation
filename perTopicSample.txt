If you come to Japan to hunt a job then you must apply for a temporary (tourist) visa that only allows you to stay in 90 days. But you might be waived for a tourist visa as you are a citizen who does not need a visa to enter Japan./>

Usually most publishers' copyrights start when they have processed the material in some way but even then, if you are not using the material for any commercial purpose or for being reproduced publically, I cannot see any problem. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then, I cannot really see any problems sending a pre-reveiw manuscript to a search committee unless it is of poor quality. Sending your work allows people to see what you are doing and a manuscript (in very good shape) will allow people to see your latest work in detail. Naturally a manuscript will not carry as much merit as a published paper since it has not been through peer review. But, if it is interesting, well written and in impeccable order you will be showing your skills in some way. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So it could provide a slight positive in a search situation if good but be very negative if bad and your judgement is what will be at stake.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

My question is: what percentage of journals are actually represented here? Some people say there are between 10,000,000 and 100,000,000 published academic documents in the sciences. Web of Science has about 50,000,000, and it's not clear how many ScienceDirect has.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A good comparison would be: if you take everything that Elsevier, Wiley, Springer, and Nature have, combined, and subtract everything that Web of Knowledge has, how many things are left?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another way to phrase it: Of the major publishers (like the ones I listed above), how many are represented in these databases?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

Most of my references cited below point this (or some variation of this) out as limitations of temporally specific computations of these laws.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Having said this, there are a few papers which might help you in this task if you haven't found them already:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.4630240607/abstract&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; paper specifically looks at generalizing Lotka's Law in the humanities and formulates the same queries that I laid out earlier about it being spatio-temporal specific.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.4630370105/abstract&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; paper is the Pao's modification to Lotka's law for humanities and has some empirical evaluations from certain humanities literature. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0306457386900762&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; paper is an empirical modification of Pao's variation (see above) to Lotka's Law in certain humanities disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.4630280115/abstract&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is an editorial response to Lotka's law applicability in the humanities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.175.4378&amp;amp;rep=rep1&amp;amp;type=pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is a general paper which looks at quantifying author productivity and impact specifically in the humanities. It is a very good read for approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In other words, do some up-to-date empirical evaluation and then perhaps, run your study. The first could actually make for a fine empirical paper by itself in the scientometrics world. Pre-configured function values are like using empirical regression estimates ; they are fine and &lt;em&gt;specific&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; study but may not be generalizable across all studies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

They look at the title. If that suggests that it's interesting to them, they read the abstract. If that's interesting enough they read the introduction and maybe the conclusion, and so on. That means that of the 4000 or so words in the paper, the five that make up the title are the most important. You're fully justified in spending as much time on the title as on 1000 words of the description of your method. The presentation of your paper is not just gloss, it determines the size of your audience. If your presentation is bad, your results have to be really exceptional to find even a small readership.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This translates directly to your Master's thesis. A nice cover shows that you care. What's more, the largest group of people that will come into contact with it, will only pick it up, look at it and put it back down again, without even really reading the title. Your cover illustration is the only opportunity you have of communicating with them and enticing them to read the title properly. From that, the summary, and from that the first paragraph of your introduction and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Don't mistake presentation for gloss.

<answer QuestionId="Is it legal to run interviews for an academic job when the post has already being assigned" AnswerId="5KTy8CUEuw9v+3EzB3wy7g==" Author="3890" Date="2013-05-17T10:26:45.830" Score="7" Text="&lt;p&gt;In many cases, academic institutions will be &lt;strong&gt;legally obliged&lt;/strong&gt; to fill positions according to the procedure you described. This usually requires publishing a call for applications in a suitable medium, and putting together a short list of selected candidates based on qualification for the position and fit to the announcement.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now there may be the &quot;problem&quot; that the person or group that will select the candidate already has a specific candidate in mind and want to &quot;assign&quot; the position to that candidate. However, simply hiring that candidate without going through the formal process would in fact be illegal. So the typical workaround in this case is to make the announcement so specific that the desired candidate will be the best qualified person for the position. It may be ethically questionable, but I fear &lt;strong&gt;it is totally legal&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Still, even for other candidates, this approach seems to be better than allowing the institution to just fill the position without the formal process. Especially if there is a committee deciding on the short list, this may even be different from the group that made up the announcement, and there may be people pushing for candidates they deem more qualified than the originally desired candidate. Chances for other candidates will clearly be rather low, but still higher than zero as in the case without announcement.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As to the question whether it is possible to find out about such a situation in advance, I fear it is not that easy. It works best when one has good contacts to people in the committee, and can ask informally about the situation. Otherwise, a reasonable approach would be to phone a contact given in the announcement and discuss details of the position. In many cases, one should be able to figure out whether the other person is open to applications or not.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

I already looked over the internet for advice for a beginner, even read two books on the subjects. Still, there is one point I haven't seen discussed as I wanted, it's the time and the way the student should be investing in catching up on his field and his specific topic, I'm speaking about the bibliographic part. For sure a student needs a lot of (continuous) input, but at the end he'll be solely judged on his output. From my previous research project, I'm not really confident in my way of balancing between going through articles/textbook material and trying to solve my own problematics. To be honest, it sometimes feels like a sneaky way of procrastinating: I'd tell myself that I'm still not ready to tackle my problem and that I need to make a little &quot;detour&quot; by existing works; and when it's done I don't feel more at ease to answer my questions. Or is it a normal aspect of research?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my specific case, I'll be working on a quite new subject (string theory) when I only had advanced lecture of quantum field theory and general relativity; so I'm thinking about going through the canonical textbook on the subject during the summer, do most of the exercises and derivations in there (which already represents hundreds of hours invested), maybe revising some mathematical tools I need to be really familiar with. Once I'll have a general idea of the topic I'll jump to the main articles in relation to my thesis. I also know that I will be using numerical tools (Monte Carlo methods) and will need to get conformable with that. So far I only have a superficial knowledge and use of the tool.&#xA;Does it seem like a good use of my time? I already know that time and willpower are limited resources in grad school and I really don't want my desire to do well to burn me out from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

You need to remember that exactly what you need to know and to read up on will only be known in a genral sense. your PhD project theme will provide this general direction. What details you need to pick up in terms of numerical methods etc. will to a lrger extent develop as your research develops. So you do not need to worry about what you could possibly have use for. You probably know key areas relavant to the topic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, you need to lay a broad foundation and read up on the topic and supporting areas (fields). If there are key methods or equivalent you can start looking at that as well. However,I ould expect your advisor will also provide guidance in setting up direction through course work and suggesting reading. I would personally not expect a student to have a complete background by the time he or she starts. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, as I state earlier, that you are thinking about this is very good but you should not worry too much because you will not know the details until you have the PhD project clearly defined and started woring with your future advisor. So any knowledge you can gain will be a bonus but you are not expected to finish your PhD until you have completed your PhD studies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

There are different amounts involved: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;: the salary of the researcher, corresponding to the gross amount, i.e. before tax. For instance, 50.000 euros per year. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;r&lt;/strong&gt;: the overhead asked by the host institution, which basically corresponds to the indirect costs of hosting the researcher (renting the office, paying the admin staff, etc). This is an agreement between the host institution and the european commission, usually calculated as a percentage of the salary. For instance, where I'm working now, it's 67%. In some places, it can go up to 100%. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt;: the travel and equipments expenses. It basically depends on the expected number of conferences to attend per year, the meetings organised for the project, etc. For instance, based on 4 conferences per year, 2500 euros per conference, that makes 10.000 euros. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C = S + rS + T&lt;/strong&gt;: the total cost of the researcher per year. For instance, that would be 50000 + 33500 + 10000 = 93500. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Req = 0.75 * C&lt;/strong&gt;: is the requested amount to the commission (assuming the host institution belongs to: profit public bodies, secondary and higher education establishments, research organisations and SMEs, 0.5 otherwise). So, for the example, we would request 70.125 euros per year. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that the request amount is 10.000 euros above the gross salary of the researcher (deducting the travel costs). In other words, one could consider that the 25% the host institution has to pay are indirectly paid by giving an office and proving staff support (who, in general, would be paid anyway, EU project or not), and therefore it does not necessarily mean that the researcher has to find another funding source for the missing 25%. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

I know the situations in many other countries in Asia are similar.

They are usually assigned by the teachers of the classes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In college, it is called the class representative. The representatives are elected by the students. The length of the term usually is a year.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Upon entering college, students already select their major. The university groups all the students having the same major into one or more classes depending on the number of students (the standard class size is 50). &lt;strong&gt;They take all the required courses together if possible.&lt;/strong&gt; The students in the same class know each other very well. The class is like a big family. Naturally, you have a representative who speaks for the class and handles all the administrative matters. You also have a deputy representative in case the rep is not available. There are other students responsible for other duties such as purchase, sports, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The rep gets elected usually because he/she is popular in the class or a good student. I would not say he gets preferential treatment from the professor/department because he is the rep. Sometimes it is the opposite. I once declined a rep nomination because I wanted to concentrate on my study.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, being a rep can be advantageous. You learn how to be a leader. You learn how to communicate with other people who are sometimes superior, such as the professor, department chair or even the dean. Leadership is not something you can learn it all from the books. You have to do it. Two of the four reps in my college class are very successful in their late career.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It would be much easier for the professor to talk to the class rep when he wants the whole class to do some unusual assignments. Once you can convince the rep it's the right thing to do, the rep would then pass the message to the whole class. You are more likely to get the cooperation from the students. I would not recommend you to use him very often, though. He represents the class, not you. He would lose the trust from his classmates when he becomes your pet student. In general, &lt;strong&gt;the class representative concept is more like the department chair of a university department&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

If the correctness of the thesis described in your article depends on fact $A$, then you either prove $A$ or give a reference to someone who proved $A$. In practice scientific reports skip some references assumed to be common (e.g. definition and properties of the logarithm): it used to be important to save printing space (not so true now with electronic proceedings), it stays important to keep the article uncluttered. Given the reasons for skipping some references, there cannot be any absolute rule about which ones to skip: the decision depends of the audience you are aiming at, and in particular of your evaluation of the knowledge in common between you and them: put references when they are necessary &lt;em&gt;to your audience&lt;/em&gt; (and do not clutter your article when they are not).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For instance, your sentence about Java being class-based would be unwelcome (in addition of unnecessary) in an article aimed at researchers in computer science, because this fact is supposed to be well known (and agreed upon).

On the other hand, the fact that Java is slower than C++ might evolve in time (e.g. java compilers getting better), or be argued against (different type of applications):  you should always give a reference for this kind of statement if you did not argue or prove it yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hope it helps!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

The reasons I think that being the EiC alone is not cause to not submit to your own journals are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&quot;Publish elsewhere&quot; doesn't necessarily work - first, you've cut the number of journals by one, and for some specialty fields, that's a rather big deal. Additionally, the EiC of a journal is likely working in a field that is particular suited to that journal - &quot;publish elsewhere&quot; forces scholarship into potentially awkward fitting publications for the sake of avoiding the appearance of impropriety. I'd much rather any such risk be addressed head on.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;What about collaborators? For fields where papers often have one or two authors, perhaps this is more clear, but my field routinely has papers with a great many more authors than that. Is any study that recruits one of the finest minds in their field (presumably) then inevitably doomed not to be able to publish in the journal that might fit their work best? What about their graduate students?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Many journals are society journals - you are effectively denying a scholarly society the easiest access to the work of one of their most prominent members (again, presumably). Yes, it could get published elsewhere. But there's no promise I &lt;em&gt;read&lt;/em&gt; elsewhere.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In essence, drawing a hard line and saying &quot;No&quot; is counterproductive - I'd rather have a journal come out with a clear and open policy that says &quot;This is how we handle submissions from our editors&quot; - all of them, than to issue blanket bans.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

I.e., they should not suggest referees, solicit or have access to referee reports, participate in the decision making, or even discuss the decision with other editors.  Furthermore, this lack of involvement should be made clear to the referees when the reports are solicited and to the public (for example, by including a paragraph in the journal's web site about how editorial submissions are handled).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ideally, there should be strong safeguards.  For example, one journal I'm associated with takes the following approach.  If the editor in chief submits a paper, the journal's sponsoring organization appoints a few associate editors to evaluate the submission anonymously and make individual decisions.  If any one of them recommends rejection, then the paper is rejected and the rest of the editorial board never finds out who rejected it.  This avoids the danger of feeling pressure from the EIC, but it leaves open the possibility of favoritism or bias, perhaps even subconsciously.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because it's difficult to avoid bias and impossible to avoid the appearance of bias, editors should rarely submit papers to their own journals, and EICs almost never.  Aside from special cases such as issues in honor of someone, the only time I think it really looks good for an EIC to submit a paper is if the paper is amazing, far above the usual level of the journal, and it's clear that the EIC is trying to raise the journal's profile by sending a paper there that could easily have been published somewhere more prestigious.  This is risky: it can come across as condescending or self-aggrandizing, it looks strange if done more than very rarely, and others may disagree on how amazing the paper is.  However, if the paper is indeed great then it at least avoids controversy over whether acceptance was appropriate.  The really dangerous scenario is borderline-appropriate papers, where reasonable people could disagree about acceptance and it's natural to wonder whether favoritism might have tipped the balance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

So if the community expresses some form of trust in the editor to publishing in their own journal this could be perfectly fine. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So when an EiC publishes in &quot;their&quot; journal it is not wrong but potentially &quot;dangerous&quot; and can be perceived as poor judgement. They would jeoparize the journals reputation. So even if thetre is no legal problems there are ethical problems. I doubt anyone would have second thoughts aboutth equalit of a journal if the editor does not publish there, after all if the editor has a solid reputation, associating with a bad journal would jeopardize that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Can I see any exceptions? Well, co-authorship may be less serious but in the end even that should be avoided. I also think that if an editor publishess a single paper in a thematic issue of the journal (where someone else has suggested a theme) and this is the only paper by that editor in the journal for years, I would not thik much about it. Obviously frequency of publications is also a factor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, in conclusion, I consider it unwise under most circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

But, some statistics might help. With prestigious journals the rejection rate might be 90% (very high in any case). I am Editor in Chief of a smaller journal and we have a steady 50% rejection rate. The extremely high rejection rates in some journals come from limited space, in my case we simply impose strict guidelines and the rejections come from reviewers assigned by associate editors. So the rate in our case is fairly certainly upheld by what the community sees as acceptable or not.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So if you end up finding you reject large numbers (at least around 50%) I would not say that it is out of the ordinary. I do not of course know what typical rejection rates are in the journals for which you do reviews, so the number may of course vary.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So getting to the question of how this affects you. I very much doubt that you get a negative effect by being a fair reviewer. If you do many reviewes over time and you are not considered fair, I am sure you would notice the numbers of appointments dropping. If you get re-invited by the same journals/editors, I think they appreciate your work and I would take that as a sign that you do fine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Should you try to adapt to the journal? In general, no. You should apply your knowledge and understanding to provide a critical review of the submitted work. An editor should take your comments along with comments from one or more additional reviewers and provide a recommendation to the authors. You are not solely responsible in this process! If the journal is such that it publishes material with which you are familiar but where its audience is in a  different field, you may consider handling the paper differently, but obviously not ignoring errors and misconceptions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

At the same time, you cannot count on corrective feedback from editors if you are &quot;too harsh&quot;, because they may not realize this, and in fact have incentive not to worry about that exigency, because you are making their job easier.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, one should note that in recent times many respectable journals explicitly declare to referees that they, the referees, are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; responsible for &lt;em&gt;correctness&lt;/em&gt; of an article. It is supposedly the author's responsibility. This is obviously strange, but can be understood when we realize that the gatekeeper function of journals, editors, and referees is at least as important as the scientific function... as disillusioning as that might be. But it does explain situations that are otherwise baffling and counter-intuitive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

There must be some important reason for that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The intellectual properties and patent issues make some sense to me since you are no longer with University B. They might cause some trouble for Prof. A.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am not convinced the corresponding authorship in your case makes a difference. First authorship does matter in China if you are also a professor at the same level, say both of you are assistant professors. He could be looked down because you made more contribution than he did. But, you are an intern. He can explain to others that you did all these under his supervision. I think he would actually earn extra credits by helping interns/students to publish papers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have the same suspicion as aeismall does. Your active affiliation may be an issue for Prof. A. Which institute will you represent when the paper is presented at the conference? Who will present the paper? I think these questions are his concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After talking to some researchers knowledgeable about the corresponding authorship in China, I learned more about the issue. Some authors don't want to be the corresponding author because they are busy with other research interests. Some are just shy away because English writing is hard for them. Some are interested in the role because they would be more widely known in his area. In most cases, the first author or the one who makes the most contribution to the paper is the corresponding author. So far, no one is able to explain to me why corresponding authors are underappreciated. It seems to have little to do with your issue.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;End of edit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

It &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be listed as a &quot;current address,&quot; but not as an active address for this paper. In that way, the professor still gets credit for your work, with your affiliation showing as being part of his group.

What this a full-blown idea, or just the kernel of something. Or, putting it differently, did he just point you in the general direction of something, or was this a relatively finished idea that just needed to be worked out in detail? Was this an idea you expanded on, or significantly improved? Did he provide significant intellectual input while the project was ongoing, or did he leave you to your own devices?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, you talked about implementation. Does this mean code, or something else? Did Professor A participate in the implementation in any way? If not, did he look at the implementation?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What about the paper itself? Did he participate in a substantial way in the writing of it?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the answer is that you did most or all of the work, and did much of the working out of the idea, then it sounds like you should be first author. If he contributed substantially, it is less clear.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, the paradigm in general is that the junior person gets the first authorship, because they need it for career reasons. Most people are willing to abide by this. I know someone whose PhD adviser put himself as first author on his (the students) papers, and the person in question regrets it now. If you go along with this, you may also regret it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you don't work for this person, the question is whether you have to do what he says for some reason. If you are hoping for a good reference, a first authorship on a paper might be worth more than a reference. Does he have any other hold on you? Do you need his further input on the project, or are you hoping to publish further papers with him? Also (perhaps not very important but serves to indicate tone) was the email polite or not? Personally, I think a conversation would have been more appropriate than an email in the circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the record, I find the argument about intellectual properties and patent issues less than compelling, but it would also help if you could say more about how these things work in your university.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

Even when they prove to be a surreal experience, they need to be given the attention appropriate to their seriousness. These are exams that you typically only have one or at most two chances to pass. As a result, you want to get through them on the first try, so that you don't have to worry about them again. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How hard you have to work does depend a lot on the structure of the exam, and based on your previous preparation. If there are a lot of subjects to be tested with which you are not familiar, you may have to work harder than if you're getting A's in all of the classes that will be tested on the exam. (Even then, you'll still want to work through some practice problems to get a feel for the kinds of questions that are asked.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As the original questioner mentions, in many cases the oral exam can be a &quot;sanity check&quot;—in more ways than one. If the decision has been largely made on the basis of the previous coursework and written quals, then the oral exam can act either to confirm the decisions of the panel, or as an effective psychological exam. One of my panels turned things into what amounted to a carnival side-show, with everybody acting completely out of character, and in a manner I found entirely unbefitting an oral qualifying exam. However, it made sense to see if there was any way to make me &quot;snap&quot; and lose my cool.

In theory, authors could use any rule they like to decide which author is the corresponding author. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, in my experience, the corresponding author is often the author who has made the largest contribution or an author who has made one of the larger contributions to the paper. The corresponding author is also often chosen as someone who is likely to have a stable contact address and is likely to remain in academia for some time to come. In that case, supervisors are sometimes corresponding authors rather than students (even where the student has done most of the work). A similar pattern can hold in the case of industry collaborations where the academic may be the corresponding author.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, in most models of ethical publishing, all authors are meant to take responsibility for the claims in the published work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

This is the first step to showing someone they've made an error without being ignorant or arrogant (the rest follows from general customs about politeness, but you absolutely must do this first bit. He supposes, presumably in good faith, that he proved something to you; the &quot;burden of proof&quot; that he's wrong now lies in your hands). Besides, this is a good exercise. Lots of things don't seem like they make sense until you yourself figure out how to make them make sense to you. This can be a lot of work. This act of &quot;hacking&quot; someone else's grand idea until it makes sense to me is how I spend most of my time. Thankfully this often leads to totally new ideas and directions that the first guy didn't see (or thought too trivial or obviously wrong to mention, yes that happens too...)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The problem is that, in very many fields, undergraduates &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; actually extremely frustrating to work with. They don't yet speak the language, or have the baseline knowledge that all of your colleagues share. But nonetheless, this person is not the ideal advisor if he lacks the patience to put up with a lot of questions -- this is &lt;em&gt;absolutely&lt;/em&gt; normal behavior for an undergraduate advisee, totally to be expected and many advisors find the interactions quite rewarding!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand though, you have some hard questions to ask yourself. Basically, you say that you want to ask questions without sounding lazy, but you must be honest with yourself about whether or not you are in fact asking lazy questions. The research process (again, at least in fields I'm familiar with) is most emphatically &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; &quot;do exactly what some famous guy told you to do.&quot; It generally involves painfully slogging through material that &lt;em&gt;no one&lt;/em&gt; really understands and proving everything you think you know to yourself repeatedly, and then to others, and then occasionally having it pointed out that you made a really silly assumption, or that some obscure paper already solved everything you had set out for. Again, the point is to create new knowledge, and so you have to know your tools inside and out. In fact, if your advisor is explaining &lt;em&gt;anything at all&lt;/em&gt; clearly and to your satisfaction, what he is explaining is, by definition, old knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

So, if your definition of &quot;trendy&quot; is highly correlated with this type of prejudice (which I think it is because, all else being equal, the number of publications in prestigious journals in your CV increases your chance of getting a job in academia), it can be a fairly reliable measure of trendiness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Annals of Mathematics Anonymous mentioned is definitely among the very top generalist journals. So checking the latest issues may tell you something about what's hot in mathematics now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The big caveat, however, is that it only publishes 50 or so articles in each year. So, if you only look up in recent issues, your statistics can't be extremely reliable. Using a record of several years defies the purpose of knowing what's trendy right now, so you're in a bit of a conundrum. Making things more complicated, each generalist journal has their own bias as well; different journals tend to publish papers of different topics more frequently.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, it might be better to take samples from multiple generalist journals which are considered among the top journals by many. Those journals typically publish an extremely small number of papers though. For example, the Journal of the American Mathematical Society published only 32 papers in 2011 (and 35 in 2010) according to ISI Web of Knowledge. Some prestigious generalist journals publish even fewer papers. (I'm not going to talk about which journals you should use for this purpose because it's inevitably controversial and subjective.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In any case, if you want to check what kind of topic is discussed in a given journal, you can do that quite easily by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;MathSciNet&lt;/a&gt;. The American Mathematical Society classified branches of mathematics and gave a code number to each branch. And they've been keeping track of publications in mathematics. Just search for the MSC code of your field with a specific journal in MathSciNet and see how many hits it returns. This way, you can see how trendy your field is as well as which prestigious generalist journal likes your kind of mathematics more.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This method doesn't always work equally well though, e.g., if you're interested in applied mathematics or mathematical sides of computer science, what the Annals of Mathematics loves nowadays may not be the most reliable measure that reflects what's trendy right now. Another example is when your field became fashionable relatively recently so there isn't a good catch-all MSC code yet. For instance, arithmetic combinatorics has seen a miraculous revival in recent years in mathematics. Ann. of Math. and other prestigious journals are publishing papers in this field, but there isn't a good MSC code to capture this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

The danger of course is timing: trends rise and fall quickly, and what might be trendy right now might not be so in a year or two (maybe in mathematics, trends move more slowly). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I'd argue that trendiness, while one potential factor, is not a universal key factor at all. Every department has their own needs. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As regards your second question, usual measures of &quot;trendiness&quot; include the relative frequency of publication in that subarea. In CS, it's relatively easy to determine this via conference acceptances, but in math I'm not sure how you'd go about measuring this frequency. It also helps to attend big meetings and listen to where the buzz is. An advisor can also be helpful in this regard (especially if they're pre-tenure and need to keep track of trends themselves :))&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

This list includes GPA, GRE, sometimes subject-specific GRE, specific coursework, specific reference letters, and the rarely-ever-listed undergraduate research/term papers that lots of people here give great advice about but that I didn't previously know was a 'thing'.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Looking over the admittance pages of prospective programs can give you an idea of this at times. In your case, I looked at a few schools math departments I'm familiar with, and using this one as an example because its not terribly atypical (but you should research your own preferred institutions): &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.math.wisc.edu/graduate/applying&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;University of Wisconsin Mathematics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;1) A GPA of at least 3.0 overall and substantially higher in mathematics courses.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;2) 18 or more credits of mathematics beyond calculus. The 18 credits should include at least one semester of both rigorous analysis&#xA;  (sometimes called advanced calculus) and abstract algebra, and&#xA;  preferably two semesters. Advanced undergraduate courses in other&#xA;  topics further strengthen your application.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;6) A “Supplemental Application Form” is required after submitting your&#xA;  online Graduate School application. It is important that you include&#xA;  all advanced mathematics courses you have completed, are currently&#xA;  enrolled in, or intend to take...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;7) Three letters that address the question of mathematical promise.&#xA;  These letters should be from mathematics faculty, or other faculty&#xA;  familiar with the demands of graduate work in mathematics...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now keep in mind that any published outlines are a &quot;wishlist&quot;, and they don't automatically toss anyone. But every area you don't fit requires explanation or some other counter-balancing factor. Some programs give a list of x requirements, then say they'll waive 1-2 of them without further explanation needed, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are missing all of these, then you need to look at a different program, but you might find no program that's a fit. If this happens, that doesn't mean you can't do something, just that you might have to go about it sideways or backtrack a bit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are missing just a few things, like a course or two, some programs have probation where they'll tentatively admit you on the demand you complete X courses on your first semester and get at least Y GPA, etc. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you might need to make arrangements to take advanced math courses at an undergrad/graduate level. It's harder to get financial aid for this sort of thing (you can't qualify for a Pell grant anymore, etc), but you can still get loans or pay for it outright. If you need this route, you need to talk personally with professors in advance to discuss what your goals are and make any possible arrangement to do extra work, write an academic research paper, etc. You need to find people you can have enough contact with to be willing to go to bat for you in writing strong reference letters if you don't already have math professors who are familiar with your past work. Join math clubs, go to math study labs, volunteer, whatever you can manage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before you go running off and doing any of this, however, you should make contact with math faculty at your present school and/or at a target school, and get an opportunity to talk with them about what you want to do and get their advice. Sometimes just showing &quot;mathematical promise&quot; can get a magic wand waived over your application, which maybe you already have - but only someone familiar with what you've done can tell you that. If you have a piece of mathematical &quot;best work&quot; from your most advanced class, bring it with you to such a meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once you've gotten a few honest appraisals of where you stand, be kind to yourself in looking for programs that will fit YOU, not some imaginary ideal program for someone else.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, one last piece of advice. Keep your mind open to hybrid possibilities. There are whole fields of study you might really like that you aren't aware of, including applied mathematics study offered by business schools, economic fields that emphasize mathematical theory and/or application, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes we have to try to mold ourselves to fit an existing mold a little better, but sometimes its trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. Talk to people and investigate the possibilities, get a clearer understanding of your relative shape, and seek out openings with geometry congruent to yours. Good luck in your journey!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

For instance, in my own field, one of the cornerstones of computer modeling was originally derived in the 1920's, and then basically remained undeveloped until the 1970's, when it was brought back in fashion. (It has since been replaced by faster methods, but it is still regarded as the &quot;touchstone&quot; for high-accuracy calculations.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, entire fields of research may have been developed before the applications caught up with them.

I can imagine that I might have an answer that is different than the other teacher (perhaps my answer is wrong, perhaps my answer is right, and perhaps both of us are right but we have different ways of looking at a problem).

Refer the student to their teacher? If they feel they cannot get an acceptable answer then refer them to a search engine?

<answer QuestionId="Can American students do research in Europe with only a bachelors degree" AnswerId="kTHvhEYVrnz9oReIEJfadw==" Author="102" Date="2012-04-05T09:09:24.803" Score="4" Text="&lt;p&gt;I think there are two parts in your question: can someone with a Bachelor from the US get a job from a university or research lab, and what kind of visa such a person would need. For the first question, it's really depending on the university. As for the visa, it depends if it would be for a PhD student, or for a &quot;regular&quot; researcher (i.e. not a student). However, in both cases, the visa application depends on the country, as far as I know, there is no Schengen Research Visa. For instance, for France, there are two types of Visa the person could apply to (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.consulfrance-washington.org/spip.php?rubrique98&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Visa section of the french consulate in Washington&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.consulfrance-washington.org/spip.php?article519&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The “Skills and Talent” Card visa (Carte Compétences &amp;amp; Talents)&lt;/a&gt;. However, for this one, they say: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;University graduates should be PhD. Lower graduates will be required to add proof of profesionnal experience in the same field for a minimum of 1 to 3 years (the lower the degree, the longer profesionnal experience expected) &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.consulfrance-washington.org/spip.php?article398&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Visas for professors and researchers holders of a &quot;convention d’accueil&quot;&lt;/a&gt;. According to this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fnak.fr/dn_Formalites/ES_criteres_eligibilite.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;site&lt;/a&gt; (in French, I couldn't find an English version), a &quot;convention d'accueil&quot; would basically be the work contract with the university/lab, and the eligibility requirement seems to be a Master degree or equivalent (but it could be the case that a 5-years US Bachelor degree counts as an equivalent to a 5-year French Master degree). As far as I understand, that would be the best option for someone who wants to do her PhD in France. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It would also be possible to apply for a student visa, but I think it's not possible to get a work contract with such a visa. Another solution could be to apply to a:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.consulfrance-washington.org/spip.php?article500&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt; Employer Sponsored visa / OFII&lt;/a&gt;. There does not seem to be anything specific to research in this case. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, to sum it up, I don't think there is a unified process to apply for a visa in Europe as a researcher, and each country has its own rules. Note that these visas are not automatically Schengen visa, and I've known the case of some extra-EU students, who obtained a visa in one Schengen country, and were not allowed to travel in other Schengen countries before becoming officially resident of the country. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

For example, if something's piecewise polynomial, and you drop three points at random into every piece, and it's accurate to within machine precision, you've almost surely got it right, and if it's not you've almost surely got it wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, once you're already well-versed in a field, you may write a paper which referees want you to compare to some other new result in the field.

It can be particularly useful, especially in tracking down issues that you have within your own code—or, perhaps, in the existing literature. My most-cited paper, and much of the research work currently ongoing within my group, came about precisely because I could &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; replicate an existing paper. As it turned out, there were some significant methodological problems in the existing literature, and this led to a fair bit of digging around, plus a lot of careful analysis to demonstrate what had happened and why. As I've also said, the issues we uncovered there indirectly led to a different line of inquiry that has already led to half a dozen additional manuscripts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are determined to speed up the process, however, you might try to consider simplified versions of the research cases presented that can validate what you're working on. For instance, can you find a &quot;prototype&quot; problem whose solution would be known with your method as well as the existing methods? Can you find one or two test cases which can test most of what you're looking for? Can you devise a new problem that compares the two better than the existing cases, and is also simpler to execute?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

<answer QuestionId="How do you judge the quality of a journal" AnswerId="y6RsqWZefUlJACZrNPK3VA==" Author="6928" Date="2013-05-31T09:30:38.813" Score="3" Text="&lt;p&gt;You can test them yourself. This procedure will speed up by your experience. There are signs during submission and during review which shows which journal is really good and which is not. But there is another way too: look at the objective information below. It is possible to judge a journal based on the COLLECTIVE information you obtain from these factors:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Their editorial. You don't know them? Ok pass to the next ones.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Their publishing country (India? no thanks unless the paper is not good or the journal is an exception).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Their publisher (yes good publishers usually select good journals, although some weak journals with a lot of money can again hire a good publisher)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The time passes since you submit and they respond&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The above factor SHOULD be considered along with the amount of manuscript they receive. Good journals receive thousands of manuscript a year, but still do not waste authors' time by keeping them waiting for too long before a rejection decision. Bad journals receive sporadic manuscripts and keep the authors wait for months until they tell the author their decision. It is a pain when you see some of them have &quot;lost&quot; you paper, or some of them reject your paper with a couple of lines of comment, after 6 months. Good journals do the same in less than 24 hours.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Indexing databases. Look where the journal is indexed in. ISI Web of Science? Medline? or what? The scam journals usually are not indexed in any accredited databases (not Google Scholar or Scopus). If a journal is accepted to be indexed in ISI or to a lesser degree, Medline, it is unlikely to be able to have low quality. Otherwise, ISI would have booted them out. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are other factors too. But these will give you 90% insight already.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

With that said, when I'm looking for the best journal to put an article, I have three methods:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look at my cites for similar work to my manuscript, then look at where they published (similar to Artem's comment).  If your paper isn't citing related work, well... it probably has a pretty terrible lit review.  If you're citing sources out of your league for that paper (i.e., Science, Nature), find the publication list for that lab to find their fallback journals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ask greybeards I collaborate with where they would publish such a paper.  Good senior academics have a huge amount of expertise about the social networks and publishing networks in their fields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use journal rankings.  I find  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scimagojr.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Scimago&lt;/a&gt; to be the most convenient.  That also charts things like cites/paper over time, so you can see if a newer journal is growing or stagnant.  The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.arc.gov.au/era/era_2012/era_journal_list.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Austrialian Research Counsel&lt;/a&gt; (mentioned by Willy Wong) is probably my #2 resource.  Thompson's ISI stuff is also useful, but I've found it sometimes has glaring omissions and has been less convenient to me (annoying to log in).  Conferences are harder to rank using indices.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=top_venues&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://academic.research.microsoft.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; have ranking systems that catch those pretty well, at least for comparing citations within a topic.  However, given the choice, I'd still go with option #1 or #2.  I mainly use this approach for interdisciplinary research that doesn't have an obvious, natural target journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;">

I would therefore recommend to make use of any possibility to zoom the window and then make a screen shot of the window as large as possible on the screen.

My friend who got his Ph.D. from the same advisor at the same time as me was also like this, and he's doing pretty well in academia. So probably all that matters when it comes to starting your own math research is if you're ready for it. And if you're ready, I don't think your advisor can talk you out of it anyway. At least, randome guys on the internet like us surely can't.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, I'd say if you're being honest to yourself and still confident that you know about your research topic better than your advisor, and if you can get him interested in your research, it should be fine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

It is definitely a good thing to try this, because it will demonstrate and help reinforce that you are an independent researcher, something which you need to be at the end of your PhD studies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But this is not without some &lt;strong&gt;risk&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Part of the role of the supervision that would otherwise be provided is to improve your skills as a researcher and writer of scientific texts. Without this guidance, your skills at the end of your PhD may not be as good as they could be.  You may have gaps in your knowledge that would need to be filled. The presentation of scientific material in your writing may end up being suboptimal, because you won't have someone to proposed better ways of writing. And worse still, your ideas may not end up being the best they could be, because you won't have someone questioning them and your assumptions, ultimately forcing you to produce better versions of your ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've seen it before. Some highly independent students I've seen in action fail to follow recognised mathematical conventions, produce new notations for existing concepts, miss key references and lack understanding of key concepts that would help improve their work, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Independence is a good trait, but try to take advantage of opportunities to receive guidance from your supervisor(s) while you can.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

If your funding is intended for you to work on a specific topic, then your primary efforts should be given to the designated topic. However, you can, if so motivated, pursue the research topic independently. In mathematics, this might not be such a huge issue, as the infrastructural demands are not so large (except for some applied math projects). However, in other disciplines, where this &quot;unsupervised research&quot; may require experimental supplies and other resources, this is a &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; bigger issue. In the latter case, you &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; obtain approval from the PI whose equipment, material, and other resources you will be using!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If your time is &quot;unrestricted,&quot; in the sense that it is not tied to any particular project or program, then you should talk with your supervisor to see if you can use some of your &quot;normal&quot; time to devote to the &quot;side&quot; project. If you can, great; if you can't, then again, this needs to be &quot;on the side&quot;—beyond your main project. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for the question of doing &quot;first-authored&quot; research, well, that transition process, in many respects, &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the goal of the PhD! If you are to be a successful researcher, then during your doctoral studies you will learn how to do research independently, and eventually unsupervised. (Moreover, you will hopefully also have the chance to learn how to supervise others!)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

The two downsides of it you list can be overcome by using a &lt;strong&gt;guided discussion&lt;/strong&gt;. When you assign the paper, also include a list of questions that you expect the students to be able to answer after having read the paper. When the class meets:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Select students at random (or through a random permutation).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Have the student answer an assigned question as a discussion seed.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Open up the floor to other students to make comments and pitch in their ideas (thus starting a discussion). &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;When the topic dies down, move to the next question on the assigned list and repeat from step 1.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This format has several advantages:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It ensures that the students have read the paper (since they might get randomly selected)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It encourages them to think of their own answers and participate in discussions.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It eliminates the intimidating factor of the professor having tight control of the discussion (since you only moderate who speaks)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It lets you address the key points of the paper (through your initial selection of questions) without having to go over the whole paper in class.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have experienced this format in upper level undergrad/grad courses during my undergrad and enjoyed it greatly.

Meanwhile, a startup approached me to consult/advise them in areas related  to algorithms in ML. Needless to say a lot of work that I do as part of my research encompasses ML deeply.  They want me to sign a mutual non disclosure  agreement (NDA)/ non compete clause before i engage as an independent  consultant with them, while pursuing my program full-time. In this context, they know well that I will be pursuing my program for at least the next 3 years.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have a few problems here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The confidentiality information covers:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;...techniques, know-how, processes, algorithms... related to current and future proposed products and services... and includes, without limitation, their respective information concerning research, experimental work, development, design details and specifications, engineering...&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am worried about this part mostly. Most ML research uses some form of classification or clustering in various domains. Every other startup is mining some patterns that they may use to their advantage. The methods used are generally known in the ML community and published in existing literature. Can a startup claim that an &quot;algorithm&quot; (which already exists in the literature) was used by me in some form at a later point of time for work unrelated to that domain? Additionally, I intend to use or publish research methods developed as part of my doctoral research during its course or in future. Does &quot;without limitation ...respective information concerning research, experimental work, development&quot; restrict me from doing this i.e can the organization restrict me from publishing work done in my doctoral program by claiming that I was also working with them during this period, so they have a right to what i publish during this time?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding confidential information:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;...if orally disclosed, designated as confidential at the time of disclosure and marked in writing as “confidential”.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Does this mean that anything said orally related to ML is considered confidential?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-Compete clause:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;...with a direct competitor of Company while engaged with Company and for thirty-six months following the termination or completion of this engagement...&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As an ML researcher, I will be working on ML in the future years to come. Asking me to stop working in ML for 36 months is equivalent to asking &quot;don't work for 3 years&quot;. Additionally, the startup does work which is similar to the kind of work a lot of analytics/data science related firms do. Most of ML research broadly falls into pattern mining in some form which almost all organizations engage in. In this context, does 36 months not seem a bit unreasonable?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What exactly can i get them to write in the NDA which informs that they are aware of my research position and do not expect IP for my academic research?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;">

Here are a few specifics that I can glean from the snippets that you've posted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm not a lawyer, but honestly I don't think you need a lawyer to interpret much of the language in an NDA.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;ONE: The NDA&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, the NDA claiming that it covers processes and know-how relating ML methods refer to anything that you are working on &lt;em&gt;related to current and future proposed products and services&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So let's say Company X is working on, let's say, movie recommendations and uses, for example, SVM (support vector machines) and collaborative filtering for the bulk of their recommendations. This does not mean that you can no longer talk about SVM and collaborative filtering with anyone - it DOES mean that you cannot talk about their particular implementation of SVM, you cannot tell people how they're doing collaborative filtering (ex: their features, their weights), you cannot mention what's in their databases and so forth. In fact, you probably can't tell people that the company uses SVM and collaborative filtering unless they tell you that you're allowed. If you develop some new technique of doing a movie recommender, you cannot tell people outside the company about it or publish it unless you get permission from the company. The key part of non-disclosure is that you basically need permission before you can talk about certain things, but common knowledge is common knowledge - it's not like the company can restrict you from talking about SVM and collaborative filtering. But if that's on their &quot;super secrets&quot; list of stuff, you better not go to a conference, give out your business card, and then say, &quot;Well I know a lot about collaborative filtering and SVM&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Usually, &quot;without limitation&quot; &lt;em&gt;DOES&lt;/em&gt; cover stuff that you work on outside of your work hours if it's directly relevant to the company. If there's a remote chance that your dissertation work and your publications might be inspired by, let's say, solving a company's problem or working with the company's data, then they actually do have the right to restrict you from disclosing your work without their permission, and may in fact claim copyright as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the bright side, there are possible recourses for you. You can talk to them and ask them explicitly that you want to &lt;em&gt;retain&lt;/em&gt; your copyright and that you want to &lt;em&gt;reserve the right to publish&lt;/em&gt; about algorithms and so forth that you develop while you're there. You can promise to not disclose the company name and line of work. You can ensure that any papers you write go through their legal department so they can rubber-stamp it before delivery. These are things though that you want to ask about before you sign the NDA. Often, you CAN negotiate on terms like this, but it depends on their legal team. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;TWO: Confidential&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that this is pretty clear. We've all taken formal logic, yes? That would mean that if something is orally disclosed to you, told to you that it's confidential, AND marked in writing as confidential, then you cannot talk about it. Unless they tell you, &quot;Our implementation of SVM is confidential&quot; and then point to the document that says, &quot;The company's SVM implementation is confidential&quot; then presumably you can talk about it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That said, it seems like their lawyers made a mistake here, because you'd think it should be an 'OR' relationship here - &quot;mentioned as confidential at time of disclosure OR mentioned in writing as confidential&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In any case, since SVM is basically public knowledge, most of what I mentioned under 1 would apply here. SVM and collaborative filtering and other stuff like that is public knowledge. However, don't say &quot;Company X does SVM and collaborative filtering&quot; in public.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;THREE: Non-compete clauses&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I can't really comment as well on this as I have no experience with non-compete clauses, but in some states they're not even legal (ex: California) and if they're phrased incorrectly to be unenforceable you might be off the hook.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'd be more concerned about &quot;who their main competitors are&quot; rather than how long the agreement is. Such an agreement wouldn't prevent you from working in ML research, but it might prevent you from working at Netflix if your current company is in movie recommendations. Much of the time the non-complete clauses are made to prevent an employee from stealing corporate secrets and other implicit knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;FOUR: Exceptions&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Don't worry about where you'd put that stuff, you're not going to be writing the NDA.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You should bring all of your concerns with them though. The main thing is that you've brought it up with them and possibly written it down, maybe in an email, so that they can get their legal department to put it in the right location.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All of that said, I think your main concern is that &quot;I can't talk about machine learning while working at this company.&quot; I'm 99% sure that isn't going to be the case. They don't care that you talk about general ML techniques or continue to do ML research, but will care if you're exposing corporate secrets, developing algorithms that might help their business with their data but not keeping it secret, or going to work for their competitors right after you finish with them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before hiring your own lawyer, I'd simply advise asking theirs about every clause in the NDA. That would save you some legal fees. If they are unable to answer, or if the answers aren't satisfactory, then you can consider getting your own lawyer to go through it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

You're out $100 and the lawyer will only tell you vague notes about what you can or can't talk (does the average lawyer know the difference between ML research at the University, and ML work at the company?)

It doesn't hurt to have a lawyer review it but the law is much more accessible that many people think./>

As such, the students should be mentioned in the &lt;strong&gt;acknowledgement section&lt;/strong&gt; but not given authorship.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That being said, if your supervisor is only using you for drill work, then maybe you should seek a better supervisor. A good supervisor should encourage their students to take an active role of novel intellectual contribution.

This could even be a professor-by-professor thing, as I've certainly never met a professor who wouldn't grant the title TA to an undergrad who puts in the appropriate amount of work./>

Those job duties go beyond what you are doing.  Therefore, you would be misrepresenting your work on your CV if you called yourself a TA, because you have not been formally appointed as a TA (and because a TA would be expected to take on additional duties beyond what you have been doing).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that this is a little different from aeismail's answer.  In many institutions, undergrads can be appointed as a TA, under certain circumstances.  That doesn't mean that you can just call yourself a TA if you feel like it.  For instance, assisting informally or helping with grading papers doesn't necessarily make you a TA; it's not unusual to hire undergraduates to help with those tasks, under some other job title -- but not as a TA.  A TA is a very specific job title, and unless you've been appointed under that job title, you should not call yourself a TA.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And I think you're misinterpreting the situation, when you presume there is a stigma against hiring undergrads as a TA.  I suspect it's more likely that there is a different explanation: that your instructor reacted negatively because you were proposing to describe yourself as a TA when you have not actually been formally appointed as a TA.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

The question really boils down to&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How best can we as instructors give guidance to students so that they will succeed in the future?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Evaluations in an educational setting can serve many purposes, but fundamentally they should be used as a tool to help students succeed.  Obviously, you have to be careful because a poor grade on a transcript can have long-term ramifications, but ignoring sloppy or unreadable work by trying to see through it is doing a disservice to the student on a particularly key issue: &lt;em&gt;communication of an idea is as important as the idea itself.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To answer your questions:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;1. Should the evaluation include evaluation of readability, proper structure etc...?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Absolutely.  To ignore this would be bad pedagogy.  Determining &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to relate this to the student without causing a misunderstanding about the idea itself is the difficult part.  Encouragement or direction to seek out writing help is a good idea, as is having students re-write or re-submit work that is sloppy.  Hopefully the work improves throughout the course; being picky at the beginning of a course can set a good standard for the rest of the course.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;2. Should such deficiencies be also reflected in the grade? If so, how much? Would it be acceptable to even fail a work just because it's completely unreadable?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The answer to this ties directly back into the first question.  I would suggest letting students re-write or submit material without penalty (or with minimal penalty) early on in a course, with the understanding that they must improve by the end.  If your only assessment is a final project, consider allowing a re-write with an incomplete grade.  But, if that is your policy, I'd strongly suggest providing a time for draft review well before the final project is due in order to minimize the need for this route.  As always, I would also spell out in a syllabus your policy and the fact that presentation is a part of the course, and I would also discuss this on the first day of class (with examples of past work that is sloppy!).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You've posed a hard question, but an extremely important one.  I probably suggest rejecting 30% of the papers I review for conferences simply because they are unreadable.  Most of the time I don't even get to the idea behind the work before I realize that it doesn't matter what the idea is because it is too poorly written (and this ends up in the review).  I want more papers that are well presented, because I'm certain some of the papers I give poor reviews to because of this problem have great ideas behind them!  Teachers that encourage students to improve their writing and presentation are necessary for this to occur.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

It will benefit the student a lot in the long run.&#xA;At my university, many professors point out bad readability and incoherent structure, although mostly on project/paper type assignments and less on weekly homework assignments.&#xA;However, it is considered important in all cases. I'm now writing my thesis and have written two research papers as part of research projects (for publication) and the comments I got on structure and readability greatly improved my writing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, I see from fellow students that they write solutions without providing reasoning and without introducing the topic and the problem they are solving. I believe this is very bad style (for group work this has unfortunately led to me rewriting the group documents many times simply to improve the structure). However, students don't often see a problem because it gets accepted by the teacher.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An important note though is that I think grammar and spelling should be of significantly less importance. For instance, the Chinese students in our class often forget the word &quot;the&quot; in writing (all documents are written in English for my master). Although this affects readability and is often pointed out by teachers, it is generally not considered an error significant enough to deduct points. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The line between decreased readability due to grammar/spelling and actual incomprehensibility is hard to determine, and should be determined on a case by case basis. Still it is important that students also learn this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In short, definitely help students in improving their structure and on communicating their ideas and force students to do so by making it affect the grade! It will only help them like it helped me! &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;EDIT: As a side note, handwritten solutions are generally not accepted where I study, but if YOU are requesting handwritten solutions, it would be unfair to deduct points for bad handwriting. Some people just don't have a nice handwriting, an unfortunate result of the modern computer era. If students CAN but don't have to hand in handwritten solutions, then it should affect the grade as it is the students choice to write instead of type (if it significantly affects the readability of course).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

There are really two components here; one of these is structural/formatting criteria, and the other is clarity. When you're in a situation where structural requirements and great care are part of the lesson you're teaching, I find it best to refuse to grade work until it has been presented in the proper format, and apply whatever late-work structure you normally use. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This teaches the lesson that formatting is not optional fluff, but is instead a precondition to being taken seriously. That said, if you're going to follow this method, your instructions on format should themselves be crystal clear and unambiguous. Ask a competent peer to follow your formatting instructions and see if they can arrive at the right format.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second question about messiness is more troublesome, and to some extent your response should depend on where you're situated within the broader track your students will follow, and what constitutes messy/sloppy. I think your response should be two-pronged:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wouldn't advocate failing students outright for unreadable work, but let them know you can't grade the assignment until you can understand it, and ask them to discuss their work with you one-on-one. Like above, allow your late-work policy to degrade the value of their work if they don't come address it swiftly. I ran into a few students who had a sense of what academic writing should sound like, with the result that they were completely incomprehensible when trying to parrot a voice they had no real command of. But they were able to explain it in person. This method allows you to show how imperative clear communication is--it's a precondition to being graded--and avoid invalidating what may have otherwise been good work. The ultimate penalty is based on how quickly the students resolve the problems with their work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Include some metric of style/quality/organization on your rubric. While I understand the inclination to see writing as something students should already know how to do--and that you probably don't see yourself as an instructor of writing--I think rubrics should always always always reflect the qualities you actually expect of good work in your field. Your rubric telegraphs your own priorities, and if you don't communicate clarity and style as a concern, it shouldn't come as a surprise when students think it doesn't matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;">

Are you grading a 2nd grade math test, or are you evaluating a doctoral thesis on neuroscience?  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If it's the former, then no; sloppiness and structure take a backseat to getting the subject matter correct.  The reason is your focus should be on evaluating the crucial element of the subject being evaluated.  At early levels of development, there must be some leniency given to presentation in order to focus on the fundamentals.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, there is a reasonable limit to how sloppy or unreadable something can be before the evaluation ceases to be useful.  Intentionally sloppy responses relying on confusion in the hopes of gaining partial credit don't deserve any credit at all.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you're evaluating a student in a near-professional setting, e.g. university and higher, then it makes sense to consider presentation as part of the grade.  Well structured, carefully written responses should get more credit than sloppy and careless ones.  Presentation becomes important because in the &quot;real world&quot; people evaluate you based on the whole package.  Nobody is going to buy a bottle of Tylenol with a hand-scribbled, barely legible label.  Likewise, even superficial details should be considered important in high level evaluations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was a sloppy student through primary school and even most of high school.  Many teachers simply refused to grade some papers that were unacceptably sloppy, and others graded what they could within reason.  None of those teachers who refused to grade a paper stick out in my mind, nor did their insistence on neatness change my behavior.  I excelled in the subjects where my understanding of the core materials mattered most, and did not focus my attention on subjects where presentation was considered more important than the concepts being taught.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Overall, I graduated in the top 5% of my high school and went on to a good college.  By the time I got my masters degree, my value of structure and presentation has improved sufficiently that I can survive in a professional environment.  Becoming a professional, I believe, is the goal of &quot;teaching&quot; organizational skills.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

As such, poor presentation or (really) bad grammar impacts this portion of the mark.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I generally don't detract from the student mark for &lt;code&gt;speeling errurs&lt;/code&gt; [sic]; even though I am a native English speaker, I am an Australian working in the US and am frequently in a quandary over whether to use Australian or American spelling.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My present students are generally from non-English speaking backgrounds, and I find their clarity generally very good, even though their turns of phrase sometimes seem awkward to me.  I give feedback on this awkwardness but, unless it impacts the clarity of their presentation, I don't dock marks for it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contribution&lt;/strong&gt; is used to address the correctness or fitness for purpose of the work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also add a further C, &lt;strong&gt;Collaboration&lt;/strong&gt;, if the work is a group project.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To directly answer your questions: Yes, and Yes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a side-issue:  Because many of my students are non-native English speakers, I also tend to allow double-submission of assignments.

The students can then take my feedback and implement it on their new submission.

Now there are situations when it would be unfair to penalize: for example, in the context of a timed exam, where students may feel rushed and may not be writing neatly. (However, I also feel that this is a largely contrived circumstance, which doesn't reflect true understanding in many important ways.) In any situation where they have had time to independently prepare their work and submit it, then presentation and writing style should definitely be taken into account.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, at the same time, unless the class is a writing class, then it's unfair to fail or strongly penalize a student who has turned in work that would otherwise be satisfactory, but was not put together well.

I then give a bonus &quot;partial&quot; grade level for a well-organized and well-written report, and similarly deduct a &quot;partial&quot; grade if it's substandard.

The main problem when evaluating is expressed by a saying in my native language &quot;muddy writing, muddy thinking&quot;. Essentially, if you cannot decipher what is written, either because it is sloppy writing or poorly expressed, then one faces problems when grading. Students often complain about grading where they sense they are misinterpreted etc. This is when we cannot understand what they are writing. Often, I believe, we also give people the benefit of the doubt and grade more leniently than what the verbatim answer would state. This is, of course, never picked up by a student. Hence a catch 22.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What can we do? The problem lies in the examination. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, we can provide clear guidelines about clarity of language and writing. This should be pointed out long before the exam, in fact early in their education. A study of Swedish students showed that they learn two ways of writing in pre-university levels. In languages, focus is on grammar, spelling and language but not content; whereas in other subjects focus is on content and not language. When they arrive at the university they do not realize that both are important; we need to tell them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Second, we can chose other means of examination where those with poor hand-writing can do better. Examples can be many: from essays through take homes to verbal and of course highly depending on the course, contents, level etc. Examples of the means of grading is to have external graders (more resources!) or to do as one of my teachers did; ask students to request everyone writes the exam with the pencil, and then after the exam use a pen to add corrections to their own exame as the teacher went through the exam. The exam was then collected and graded by the teacher. I mention this as an example, fully realizing it would not work in every situation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So the answer for me is no, but our assessment is always tainted by many factors whether we want it or not. To reduce the element of subjectivity is what we would be looking for.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

The ability to write a really cool, super efficient block of logic which nobody can understand is simply producing a ticking time bomb which will explode as soon as someone else goes to edit it.

Coding is not just about making a solution - it's about making a solution which will not explode 12-18 months later.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the academic side, I also have students who have similar problems where they do not care much about being careful in their writing. I generally handle them like this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I can understand it, but it is difficult, then I will mark them based on the overall quality of their work. If it is difficult to understand then the quality of their work is not great.

Also, around a third of the VR editorial board are also on the JoV board, and Denis Levi is about to transition from VR editor in chief to JoV editor in chief. Given these similarities, I guess the fact that the whole field hasn't abandoned VR suggests that people still feel there is a place for it.

Many of those who prefer it to the alternatives may nonetheless not submit to it due to lack of funding. Therefore it's hard to conclude anything from the continued success of other journals.  It is more valid to compare two subscription journals, e.g. VR and Perception, one of which is published by Elsevier and one not. Again however, there is a major confound- the VR impact factor is lower, and many authors feel they must publish in the higher-impact journal to win grants or a permanent job./>

If there isn't strong support for leaving Elsevier, then any move is likely to fail, as it will probably involve a new venture (such as a new journal) requiring the support of many, many researchers in the area, perhaps as authors, editors, or readers pressuring their university to subscribe to the new journal. If the research community is not supportive, this may because they have very good reasons or it may be out of ignorance / lack of imagination of the alternatives. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Discussion of the possibilities in your researcher community serves to explore the options, educate, and potentially build support. You may be able to start a discussion of the issues on mailing lists, social media, or run a &lt;a href=&quot;http://openwetware.org/wiki/OpenVisionScience&quot;&gt;conference symposium/satellite&lt;/a&gt; related to this topic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If there is community support, there are a few possibilities for actually making the move. In most (all?) cases, Elsevier owns the journal and its name, therefore one cannot simply switch publishers and keep the same journal name. As a work-around, moves have occurred when all or most of the members of editorial boards of Elsevier journals &lt;a href=&quot;http://oad.simmons.edu/oadwiki/Journal_declarations_of_independence&quot;&gt;resigned and started a new journal&lt;/a&gt;, usually issuing an open letter explaining their action and encouraging the community to submit to and subscribe to the new journal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A new journal can use the traditional subscription model or be open access. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With a subscription model, one can use a traditional publisher- a non-profit university press may be less objectionable than Elsevier or one of the other mega-profitable corporate publishers. I have &lt;a href=&quot;http://openwetware.org/wiki/OpenVisionScience#Publishing_Solutions-_subscription_model&quot;&gt;started a list of possible publishers&lt;/a&gt;. To get started with a new publisher, one must convince them that they will make enough from subscriptions for the new journal to be worth their while. This may be difficult, as new journals are frequently risky. It takes a few years for a journal to receive an impact factor, and may also take years to be indexed by the major databases, and many authors will only submit to journals that have already achieved these things.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An open-access journal can use the author-pays model, in which case a large publisher can provide all the traditional services (manuscript submission software system and reviewing workflow management, layout, copyediting, production, webhosting, accounting, exporting to databases, DOI registration, proper metadata, etc.)  or it can be run on a shoestring, with academics handling everything perhaps with a few administrative staff. For research communities willing to submit all their manuscripts in LateX, this is quite feasible but for communities that demand layout (figures and text arranged to fit a standard page appearance and possibly typesetting) be done, this is more labor-intensive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Several open-source software tools assist in publishing journals. Open Journal Systems is most like a traditional journal publishing platform but I hear it may be difficult for academics to use. Annotum is based on Wordpress and I believe it works by having authors write their manuscript directly in its software, so that it can guarantee that the paper will look exactly as you expect it (WYSIWYG). It is used by PLoS Currents and other journals. All of these tools could probably use more skilled programmmers contributing to the project.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am only a researcher, not a publisher, so perhaps not everything I have written here is correct. I think we researchers are in particular need of estimates of the person-hours needed to publish and manage a journal by various methods, so that a research community considering a move can budget appropriately / be comfortable knowing what they're getting into.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

<answer QuestionId="A major journal in my field is published by Elsevier How can we move the field to a less objectionable more open publisher" AnswerId="OL20T0/S27u/iwGBz/gzrg==" Author="591" Date="2012-04-05T13:45:26.860" Score="15" Text="&lt;p&gt;As a publisher who has launched an OA journal and seen what it takes to do so, I see the biggest problem for starting any journal being lack of an &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_factor&quot;&gt;Impact Factor&lt;/a&gt; (IF). I've polled authors at ECVP and about 90% said IF is what determined where they submitted. Everyone knows why this is, so why don't academics turn inward and try to undermine this reliance on IFs? Doing so would insert true competition into the journals market. Maybe academics have tried to do this, though I've never read of any real substantial attempts. I could be wrong. The second problem after IF and before funding is loyalty. Ed board members are often tied to multiple journals and in those first few years you really need those big names on your board to commission for the journal. Big names often care more about another journal or just don't care. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You need a publisher, be it nonprofit or profit, that can put in the work to promote the journal and help commission. Financially, OA journals are very easy to start. Subscription journals require more financial backing, which perhaps could be gotten through grants if you don't want to be tied to a commercial publisher. The answer is long and requires lots of discussion and more important, commitment. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

Unfortunately, as long as IF is the only widely-recognized measure that is perceived to be correlated with journal quality, research administrators and bureaucrats and grant reviewers will continue to judge us by it. Some people are working to address this by developing alternative metrics.  Try #altmetrics on twitter, and total-impact.org for one example. Of course, the only real way to judge research is to read the paper, but no-one has time for that :) &#xA;&#xA;Alex/>

I dont know if Academia is the right site to post , but since the nature of the job is Research and people involved &quot;Research Engineers&quot; , i believe is the right place.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So , i need to write a great recommendation/reference letter, but the problem is i never wrote a letter of this kind before. I ve seen many of them , and even more on the web but the problem is that they all look &quot;copy-pasted&quot; and not written in a way that would make me believe that the author of this letter really spent time on it , believing in the skills of his employee and really wanted to recommend him.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I ve already wrote the letter , the best i could and i will like to ask about some parts of it , how they sound and if they could get any better.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1)&lt;/strong&gt; As a first paragraph  , i wrote who i am , the position i have in the Research Center and what is the purpose of this letter:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;my name is .. i am a .... &#xA;&#xA;The purpose of this letter, is to serve as a reference to my cooperation with Mr ...&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2)&lt;/strong&gt; In the second paragraph i wrote about the position of the person (Research Engineer) and for how long he worked with us:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Mr. X  joined our team in the X Research Center as a full-time Research Engineer under an ongoing X month contract...&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At this point i dont know how i could point out better the fact the the person was under a normal full-paid contract and not just given a &quot;European Grant&quot; to work with us. I wrote he is a &lt;code&gt;full-time&lt;/code&gt; , but still there are many people that join programs after studies that work for a few months as Engineers in Research Centers. In this case , i want to stress that he was working as normal Research Engineer , especially chosen for his skills and payed a normal salary for his position as Engineer. Maybe add something like &lt;code&gt;&quot;full payed contract&quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3)&lt;/strong&gt; In the 3rd paragraph i wrote under what framework the person worked(European project) and a few words where and how he was involved. I didnt want to go into great details here as i believe this stuff could be easily read from his great cv. Or is it wise to describe exactly what he did(Names of real-life applications that was part of developing etc). I pointed out that he was deeply involved in what he did , how well he integrated with the rest of the people how motivated he was and that he actively contributed in the project. Anything else i could add here?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4)&lt;/strong&gt; As a last line i would like to show that i cant recommend him enough , but without getting &quot;too excited&quot;. I want it to be serious, i want it to leave no doubts. Also since the person is young , he is interested in continuing with post graduate studies , or working as a Researcher or even getting a computer engineer position in a private company. Is it ok if i mention all of them? Usually we recommend someone for one type of position. But his position , working as computer engineer doing research(aka Research Engineer) , leaves no doubt that he would be great as a phD student , as a researcher or as a software engineer. So i wrote:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;For all the aforementioned reasons I would like to highly recommend X , as a strong candidate for future postgraduate studies , research and employment offers.&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What do you think about it? How could i make it better and is there something i should change? If you dont like some part and you give me an alternative please point out why you dont like the part , as some times its a bit of personal taste and not that something is wrong. Would be great , if you could post some examples of letters you composed or parts of them , or an example from the web that you consider great.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

As a summary, I'd like to highlight some sections of it that I've found repeated in other such articles as well:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be Concrete&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;If you take away just one piece of concrete advice, let it be this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The single biggest problem with most letters is that they are filled&#xA;  with abstract generalities and infinitives. If we don't know you or&#xA;  your institution, we can't judge what any of these statements mean&#xA;  relative to our standards. Always consider the illustrative anecdote:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Due to deadline pressure, I asked him to grow a pumpkin in just one month. As you know it takes over 100 days to grow a pumpkin, but over the weekend he devised a new method to accelerate their growth. On Monday morning I arrived to find not just a pumpkin but a steaming, flavorful pie. &#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Anecdote about acts of raw coding are only so helpful in understanding&#xA;  research potential, but they're better than nothing (see the section&#xA;  on Corporate Letters, below). An extra book or paper they read, and&#xA;  demonstrated understanding of (again, be concrete about why you&#xA;  believe this), goes a long way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corporate Letters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;An important special case is the corporate letter: when you, the&#xA;  letter-writer, work in industry and have no academic affiliation. Many&#xA;  corporate letters (like many academic letters, but more so) tend to be&#xA;  vapid, clearly written in a different culture and for a different&#xA;  audience. Unless they actually did academic research with you, here&#xA;  are some suggestions for improving them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;A common mistake is to focus on teamwork. This is important even in&#xA;  academia, but often this is the primary focus of the letter, which&#xA;  makes it less valuable. Of course we care about it, but it's secondary&#xA;  to their technical skills.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;ol&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Tell us if they learned something particularly quickly, mastered a&#xA;  complex technology, or solved a problem others were stuck on. Give&#xA;  us a paragraph of details.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;If you have a concrete reason to evaluate research potential, do so concretely. Otherwise, don't bother.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Give us a brief bio-sketch, including educational qualifications.&#xA;  4.Put the applicant in context, and tell us the context. It's fine to relate it to your own student days, or to your experience hiring students.&#xA;  E.g.&#xA;  &lt;ul&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Compared to the students I studied with at Cucumber and Melon University, and the ones I now recruit from there, I would put him in&#xA;  the top 10%.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;">

Follow up by stating who you are in terms of your professional status (expertise) and your relation to the applicant. The purpose is to make the recipient aware of your standing relative to the applicant, it makes it easier to value your comments.

It may end up more than one paragraph because you may need to discuss the research done (type of research past and present) in one paragraph and then follow up on the person's ability to attarct funding and colaboration in a second (depending on length). You also need to value the publications briefly in terms of journal impact factors and citations, in other words the quality of the published work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;3rd part (one or more paragraphs)##&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You need to write about the personal side of the applicant, starting out with for example ability to collaborate and contribute to the research and work environment. This can be followed up bu more personal aspects and &quot;soft values&quot; that descfibes the persons pesronality at work and elsewhere.

Honesty is what everyone expects. I think it is valuable to also mention weaknesses as long s they are done fairly and with insight. The employer will want to know the person, not just the glossy exterior. This part is always trickiest to write and also very personal so additional advice is hard to provide.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

However, I'm going to make a few guesses and if any are wrong then you might want to disregard this answer altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It sounds like you have more education but less teaching experience than the other instructor. If you are new to teaching, one very common issue that new teachers often overestimate students' abilities. If the other instructor has more teaching experience then you might be better off 'going with the flow' for this first semester.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another reason to go with the flow is, as Chris Gregg pointed out in his comment above, students once given a syllabus should not have it changed on them mid-stream. It's bad enough (for them) to have to deal with a change in instructor, they should not also have the syllabus changed on them as well. Consider what you could learn from the way the other instructor designed the course - we can learn things from those with less education than us.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't know what you mean by &lt;em&gt;treated like some kind of stocks in a bursary market&lt;/em&gt; but, of course, without students there is no point of teaching so, yes, they are important. Nobody wants a large group of students to leave.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, my suggestion is to try one semester following the other teacher's guidance and next semester consider taking everything you know, and everything you learned, and improve things.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

The other lecturer and me, we both have the same time teaching, approximately 5 years in a row.

I would say that if you can change some material to what you think is best, without changing the syllabus (which might not be possible if you want to add something new) then you should. However, you might want to try teaching the 'other' way to see how it goes. I remember when I was learning to debate as an undergrad, the most interesting was when I had to argue the side I did not agree with at all. It really opened my eyes./>

The &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_factor&quot;&gt;Wikipedia article on impact factors&lt;/a&gt; summarises a study that found that &quot;the percentage of total citations occurring in the first two years after publication varies highly among disciplines from 1-3 percent in the mathematical and physical sciences to 5-8 percent in the biological sciences.&quot; (Nierop, 2009).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Google Scholar uses the five year &lt;strong&gt;h-index&lt;/strong&gt;.

In such cases the selection may result in a single journal. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To publish in a variety of journals seems to be a means by itself for many but I think the reasons still vary. There may be advantages in getting published in many journals to show that the research has wider applications and is accepted more generally. It may be a way to avoid the suspicion that you have a back way into a single journal (not that that would be true). In some cases, you may select different journals because you know your ideas are not favoured by someone in a specific journal's editorial board (strategic reason).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So reasons for spreading the publications may vary quite substantially.

This is especially important if your work bridges several fields. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, my research is about human-robot interaction, so I have to decide whether to publish an article in a journal that is read primarily by roboticists or social scientists/psychologists. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this case, it is also vitally important to adjust the paper to its target demographic. Psychologists don't know (and likely don't care) about my implementation details while roboticists are more likely to be interested in nitty gritty details about the code and less about the nuances of the social psychology theory behind it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

<answer QuestionId="Publishing in one vs many journals" AnswerId="7HC1JNEDa1pO76kWdcjv1g==" Author="946" Date="2013-05-24T19:30:46.813" Score="5" Text="&lt;p&gt;In my field (mathematics), the quality of journals is a quite fuzzy notion; we do not rely very much on metrics like the impact factor, but have a subjective and qualitative sense of prestige of journals. Inevitably, the way a given journal is regarded changes from one person to another. As a consequence, publishing in a variety of journals increases the odds that someone looking at your publication list will think &quot;whao, she published in X!&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another point is that if one publishes a large fraction of its research in one journal, people can wonder whether she has a friend in the editorial board that help her getting accepted there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All in all, it seems preferable (and possible, given the large amount of journal in the field) to publish in a variety of journal for hiring, promotion and more generally evaluation matters. Of course, the picture is certainly different in other fields.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

While I generally want students to come to class, there are valid reasons for being absent (e.g., I'm currently teaching classes to military members who often have duty that preempts class attendance).  I can also point students to a video to review if they ask me questions explicitly covered in class (and also for general review).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open access.  I think it's pretty cool to live in a world where it is possible to get free access to videos that enhance knowledge.

I would also hope that someone is doing research on these types of course offerings, to see if they are really having benefits to the people that watch them.  I don't believe the bottom line at extremely selective schools will ever be hurt by offering free course material, but if they do start feeling the pinch I imagine they will change their models.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sites like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coursera.org/&quot;&gt;Courseara&lt;/a&gt; are for profit and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/04/08/coursera-begins-make-money&quot;&gt;starting to make money&lt;/a&gt; by offering to verify certificates of completion for a cost.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Why, then, some [Universities] charge enormous fees for attending courses?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The question of college expense is a can of worms that has as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=why+is+college+so+expensive%3F&amp;amp;aq=f&amp;amp;oq=why+is+college+so+expensive%3F&amp;amp;aqs=chrome.0.57j60l3j59j62.4484j0&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&quot;&gt;many differing answers as there are people asking about it&lt;/a&gt;.  Selective colleges charge what they do because (1) it is expensive to run a brick-and-mortar college, and (2) the applications keep rising and kids can still get loans, grants, and other aid.  Obviously it is much more subtle than that, and it would take &lt;a href=&quot;http://freevideolectures.com/University/UC-Berkeley/Economics/Subject/Page1&quot;&gt;more than a few free economics courses&lt;/a&gt; to get to the bottom of it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

Your personal reasons are very laudable, and I understand and support them. &#xA;&#xA;But from the point of view of university: it spends additional money on professors to record videos/prepare material for online course (not necessary directly, but it still pays for professor's time), and then puts it online for free, it is a loss of money which is not offset by the students paying fees - unless you increase them.

YMMV.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, These letters are among the last things that are looked at. We don't have rigorous thresholds for grades, GRE scores, subject GRE scores, publications, etc. But all of those things are used to &quot;objectively&quot; sort the pool. First the obvious admits are skimmed off the top, and fellowship offers are made to some of them. This is the first place where letters are important, since quotes are mined from those letters to try and win funding for these students from the University (i.e., we entice the student with a prestigious award, and the department doesn't even have to pay for her!) The money quote is usually a ranking and/or direct comparison -- &lt;em&gt;&quot;In my twenty years at Giant State University, I've seen no more than 5 students of X's caliber. I would say her talents remind me of Y's at that age, who is now a professor at Prestigious U&quot;&lt;/em&gt; -- and this is why even a mediocre teaching letter is more useful for this purpose than a nice letter from a PhD student (who can not be counted on to have a reasonable intuition for another's future potential).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Second, we work our way down to the marginal cases; this is much more difficult since the marginal cases require a more holistic take on the application package. No one gets immediately thrown out just for bad grades or a bad subject GRE score, but we expect some explanation of a mitigating circumstance (not an excuse!) in the personal statement, and hopefully reflected in the letters as well. For example, if you were dinged in the first pass for a low GPA, we would like to see that it was a bad first year (and not a bad fifth...); that you are on an upswing. If you think you might be a marginal case for whatever reason, the letter from the PhD student might be helpful -- perhaps you don't have any publications, but the PhD student can vouch for your work and verify that you have something in preparation, or explain why your project failed (projects often fail!) but that nonetheless you mastered some state-of-the-art technique on the way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the other hand&lt;/em&gt; it is a big waving red flag if those things are then &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; pointed out by your actual boss (the PhD holding supervisor). If you think the student will write a &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; letter, then you're probably best off having that student lobby on your behalf with the professor, to make sure the &lt;em&gt;professor's&lt;/em&gt; letter is strong, and then get a second letter from someone else.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would strongly recommend you do not ask for a letter from a non-academic unless it was an actual research position (and even then, these can be iffy if the supervisor has no letter-writing experience). On occasion we see glowing letters from a student's supervisor at their summer construction job, or a call center for a political campaign. Well-rounded students are great, but such letters are almost useless.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

So you should start with the idea that your advisor's approach to any given situation is probably worth trying, and only give up on it if it's clearly not working out or seems contrary to what everyone else is saying.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, I'm sure it varies between fields.  I wouldn't presume to offer advice to someone in a biology lab on how to sort this issue out, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The most important thing, which you absolutely must do no matter what, is to inform your advisor in detail of any help you receive.  This is a matter of intellectual honesty, while everything else is a matter of convention or wise strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What you want to avoid is the following scenario: you meet with X, then meet with Y and explain what X said, then meet with X and convey Y's response to X's ideas, then meet with Y again and relay information back from X, etc.  If you try this and are a little vague about the line between your own ideas and what you learned in your last meeting, then you can pull it off for a while, but eventually you'll be in big trouble when X and Y talk.  Even if you never actually lied, but just let people assume you were contributing more than you actually did, they'll be very unhappy if they decide you weren't contributing enough.  [And this can be a particular danger for students: if someone says something cryptic and then you figure it out later, is that because you are adding new ideas and insights, or because you are catching up to where the expert already was?  It can be hard for a beginner to judge, and this potential for confusion is a valid worry for advisors.]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As to how to introduce the idea to an advisor who resists getting outside help, the main thing is to understand why.  Is it because your advisor feels this is an important learning experience for you?  Is the advisor convinced that the problem is not as difficult as you fear?  (And, if so, can you make a compelling case that it is?)  There are also more worrisome scenarios.  For example, maybe the local expert in this area is notorious for competing with or undermining students, or has a bad relationship with your advisor.  Your advisor may be reluctant to say this explicitly, so if he/she seems to be ruling out a natural collaborator for unclear reasons, then you should ask about other people you might talk with instead.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

In the case of calculus, if a student is required to take it for their non-math major then you will certainly have students who just want the grade. One way around this is to only teach elective classes but that will not work for everyone (I'm not sure it would work for any teacher).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Still, your questions are clear. How do you find the students who don't really care? I find that they usually bubble to the surface quite quickly. I tend to be quite interactive with my students, asking lots of questions. I also give them additional 'required' reading. Even the required reading doesn't get read by the students who just want to pass and be done with it. So, those students who actually read the material and can answer it meaningfully in class are the students you are looking for.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, as for identifying institutions I will say that I have read a lot and talked to a lot of teachers and one thing EVERY serious teacher wants is to teach a class of highly motivated students who care deeply for their studies. This is simply unrealistic and I have never heard of a teacher who actually achieves that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think the better question to ask is: &lt;strong&gt;How can I motivate a deep love of my subject in my students?&lt;/strong&gt; By stimulating their desires, you will naturally end up with what you want. However, this is not easy and it takes a lot of time and effort. However, you seem like a serious teacher, so perhaps you can make the investment. Certainly the results, if you succeed, would likely be very rewarding for you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My perspective is that a great teacher has no bad students. By this, I mean that a great teacher is able to motivate their students to &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to learn the material. By this measure I am not a great teacher, but I keep trying.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

The results may surprise you!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As far as an institutional perspective, I again don't know if there's a way to really lay things at the feet of the institution for &quot;encouraging&quot; such behavior. It can vary a lot from department to department, and even faculty member to faculty member. However, one issue can be to see how seriously the department you're interested in takes teaching duties. Is it something people are doing their best to get out of, or are they trying to do the best job they can with it? Does the department encourage &quot;out-of-the-box&quot; thinking in how to teach classes, or is it just something to get over and done with each semester?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But a lot of it also relies on your attitude. If you make it clear to the students that you're serious about them &lt;em&gt;learning&lt;/em&gt;, rather than just &lt;em&gt;regurgitating&lt;/em&gt; for the purpose of an exam, the students who stick with you will probably be more motivated than if they don't think you are invested in their learning. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

<answer QuestionId="Do media interviews enhance or potentially spoil academic reputations" AnswerId="WPG6pGV/7bRepPRQNZ3bwQ==" Author="4394" Date="2013-05-26T10:38:00.933" Score="9" Text="&lt;p&gt;The simple answer is that it depends on in what context the appearance occurs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you become visible as an expert in your field your appearances will build your reputation among the public as an expert. As such you will gain a positive (trustworthy) reputation which I am sure will be seen as positive in many respects. The university will gain credit by having employees appear as experts In my country all faculty also are mandated to convey science to the general public and appearances in media is one way to do this. So my guess is that the department and the university as well s your own discipline will see this as beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Obviously, if you appear with politically incorrect views it will all be negative. Another problem that I am sure will appear is jealousy from colleagues who do not appear in media. In the end your success depends on how you get portrayed in the media. My university runs media training to ensure that faculty represent the university in an appropriate way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the end positive media visibility is not likely to strongly affect your research career in terms increased funding, the systems should not really be influenced by it but we all al human. Media visibility will mainly affect the way you, your discipline, the university etc. is perceived by the public. It may, for example, influence the way politicians distribute research funding.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, media interviews can potentially both enhance or spoil a career depending on the context in which you appear. I believe it is important to know how media works and universities often have programs (and sometimes also rules) to help in such contacts. Depending on the type of question to which you are requested to respond you need to be able to assess how answers will be used or perceived. If the interviews are on non-controversial topics, it is probably not problematic but if you are approached on a burning issue, be aware and be savy&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

<answer QuestionId="Why are CS researchers reluctant to share code and what techniques can I use to encourage sharing" AnswerId="40RrZ0Frdy2+LAaVfG3pMQ==" Author="705" Date="2013-05-28T04:59:46.483" Score="18" Text="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why researchers might be reluctant to share their code:&lt;/strong&gt; In my experience, there are two common reasons why some/many researchers do not share their code.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, the code may give the researchers an important advantage for follow-on work.  It may help them get a step ahead of other researchers and publish follow-on research faster.  If the researchers have plans to do follow-on research, keeping their code secret gives them a competitive advantage and helps them avoid getting scooped by someone else.  (This may be good, or it may be bad; I'm not taking a position on that.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Second, a lot of research code is, well, research-quality.  The researchers probably thought it was good enough to test the paper's hypotheses, but that's all.  It may have many known problems; it may not have any documentation; it might be tricky to use; it might compile on only one platform; and so forth.  All of these may make it hard for someone else to use.  Or, it may take a bunch of work to explain how to someone else how to use the code.  Also, the code might be a prototype, but not production-quality.  It's not unusual to take shortcuts while coding: shortcuts that don't affect the research results and are fine in the context of a research paper, but that would be unacceptable for deployed production-quality code.  Some people are perfectionists, and don't like the idea of sharing code with known weaknesses or where they took shortcuts; they don't want to be embarrassed when others see the code.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second reason is probably the more important one; it is very common.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to approach researchers:&lt;/strong&gt; My suggestion is to re-focus your interactions with those researchers.  What are your real goals?  Your real goals are to understand their algorithms better.  So, start from that perspective, and act accordingly.  If there are some parts in the paper that are hard to follow or ambiguous, start by reading and re-reading their paper, to see if there are some details you might have missed.  Think hard about how to fill in any missing gaps.  Make a serious effort on your own, first.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are at a research level, and you've put in a serious effort to understand, and you still don't understand ... email the authors and ask them for clarification on the specific point(s) that you think are unclear.  Don't bother authors unnecessarily -- but if you show interest in their work and have a good question, many authors are happy to respond. They're just grateful that someone is reading their papers and interested enough in their work to study their work carefully and ask insightful questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But do make sure you are asking good questions.  Don't be lazy and ask the authors to clear up something that you could have figured out on your own with more thought.  Authors can sense that, and will write you off as a pest, not a valued colleague.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Very important:&lt;/strong&gt; Please understand that my answer explaining why researchers might not share their code is intended as a &lt;em&gt;descriptive&lt;/em&gt; answer, not a &lt;em&gt;prescriptive&lt;/em&gt; answer.  I am emphatically not making any judgements about whether their reasons are good ones, or whether researchers are right (or wrong) to think this way.  I'm not taking a position on whether researchers &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; share their code or not; I'm just describing how some researchers &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; behave.  What they &lt;em&gt;ought&lt;/em&gt; to do is an entirely different ball of wax.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The original poster asked for help understanding why many researchers do not share their code, and that's what I'm responding to.  Arguments about whether these reasons are good ones are subjective and off-topic for this question; if you want to have that debate, post a separate question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And please, I urge you to use some empathy here.  Regardless of whether you think researchers are in right or wrong not to share their code in these circumstances, please understand that many researchers &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; have reasons that feel valid and appropriate to them.  Try to understand their mindset before reflexively criticizing them.  I'm not trying to say that their reasons are necessarily right and good for the field.  I'm just saying that, if you want to persuade people to change their practices, it's important to first understand the motivations and structural forces that have influenced their current actions, before you launch into trying to browbeat them into acting differently.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Appendix: I definitely second Jan Gorzny's recommendation to read the article in SIAM News that he cites.  It is informative.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

It requires, among others:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;writing documentation and installation instructions,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;making sure the code is runnable on a variety of computers and operating systems (I code on Ubuntu, but you may code on Windows, so I have to get a Windows virtual machine to make sure it works there too), &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;answering maintenance questions of the form &quot;why do I get this and that compilation error when I compile your program on the new version of Ubuntu&quot; (go figure. Maybe the new version of Ubuntu dropped some library required by the code? who knows).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;taking care of 3rd-party dependencies (my code may work fine, but it depends on some 3rd-party jar file whose author decided to remove from the web).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, I should be available to answer questions and fix bugs, several years after I graduate, when I already work full-time in another place, and have small kids.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And all this, without getting any special payment or academic credit for all that effort.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One possible solution I recently thought of is, to create a new journal, &lt;strong&gt;Journal of Reproducible Computer Science&lt;/strong&gt;, that will accept only publications whose experiments can be repeated easily.  Here are some of my thoughts about such a journal:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Submitted papers must have a detailed &lt;strong&gt;reproduction&lt;/strong&gt; section, with (at least) the following sub-sections:&#xA; - &lt;em&gt;pre-requisites&lt;/em&gt; - what systems, 3rd-party software, etc., are required to repeat the experiment;&#xA; - &lt;em&gt;instructions&lt;/em&gt; - detailed instructions on how to repeat the experiment. &#xA; - &lt;em&gt;licenses&lt;/em&gt; - either open-source or closed-source license, but must allow free usage for research purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The review process requires each of 3 different reviewers, from different backgrounds, to go through this section, using different computers and operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After the review process, if the paper is accepted for publication, there will be another &lt;strong&gt;pre-publication step&lt;/strong&gt;, which will last for a year. During this step, the paper will be available to all the readers, and they will have the option to repeat the experiment and also contact the author in case there are any problems. Only after this year, the paper will be finally published.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This journal will enable researchers to get credit for the difficult and important work of making their code usable to others.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;EDIT: I now see that someone already thought about this! &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/reproducibility&quot;&gt;https://www.scienceexchange.com/reproducibility&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Science Exchange, PLOS ONE, figshare, and Mendeley have launched the Reproducibility Initiative to address this problem. It’s time to start rewarding the people who take the extra time to do the most careful and reproducible work. Current academic incentives place an emphasis on novelty, which comes at the expense of rigor. Studies submitted to the Initiative join a pool of research, which will be selectively replicated as funding becomes available. The Initiative operates on an opt-in basis because we believe that the scientific consensus on the most robust, as opposed to simply the most cited, work is a valuable signal to help identify high quality reproducible findings that can be reliably built upon to advance scientific understanding.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

<answer QuestionId="Why are CS researchers reluctant to share code and what techniques can I use to encourage sharing" AnswerId="3WUzoh0QjKyNNxOS9e1kAw==" Author="1174" Date="2013-05-28T01:07:28.133" Score="9" Text="&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.siam.org/news/news.php?id=2064&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; in SIAM News sheds some light on the first question, so it might be worth a look.  It argues, for a mathematical audience, why researchers &lt;em&gt;ought&lt;/em&gt; to publish their source code, and lists many of the reasons you might hear why researchers do not share their source code.  It does so by a clever analogy, one that compares the sharing of mathematical proofs to the sharing of  source code.  Take a look; it has quite an extensive list of reasons why researchers might prefer not to share their source code (as well as some responses arguing that those reasons are not good ones).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here's a citation:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Top Ten Reasons To Not Share Your Code (and why you should anyway).

If they share the code, catching their mistake/error/modifications becomes very easy leading to failure in either their MS/PhD or research project which is undesirable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In CS research and especially publication, developing code, particularly a lengthy, complex code is a non-trivial task and in most of the cases is considered money-making and paper-generating asset. By sharing the code to the public, they are unveiling facts in very much detail which may degrade their contribution in future researches. Also they may not be the only one who can regenerate article and make credit of that particular research and code. In most of the cases, master students pick an algorithm or method, slightly change it and submit a thesis and paper based on it, that may contradict with the findings and claims of the first author. Remember &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Herndon&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Thoma Herdon&lt;/a&gt; a graduate students who criticized findings of two eminent economist of Harvard university(&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_in_a_Time_of_Debt&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; is the link ). If the codes in CS are revealed the consequences are likely catastrophic (it might not be too many cases, but if happens it will be catastrophic).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Codes are vital property to most of the researchers to conduct experiment and research. If you have a code, you can simply play with it and modify it to generate new set of findings that might be more valuable than the initial findings. Without having authorship of the initial author, there is no credit to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, Elsevier recently introduced a new feature using COLLAGE called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.elsevier.com/physical-sciences/computer-science/executable-papers&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Executabale Papers&lt;/a&gt; that is currently available for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/00978493&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Computers &amp;amp; Graphics&lt;/a&gt; journal by which codes and data are available and researchers can modify the code and input values to play with.

However, if you plan to work in an applied field,a white paper is valued highly because it shows you are aware of the current issues in your field. In general, white papers are issue-oriented.&#xA;For example, in the field of architecture &quot;green&quot; building materials are valued over traditional. But why? A white paper could present facts on &quot;green&quot; building materials versus traditional materials in terms of cost and performance. Other factors could also be weighed such as customer preference. Therefore, when the executives of a firm read the white paper it could help them make a major decision on materials they will buy in the future.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;See below the definition of white paper:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;White papers in business-to-business (B2B) marketing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Since the early 1990s, the term white paper has been applied to documents used as B2B marketing or sales tools. Far more commercial white papers are now produced for B2B vendors than political white papers for governments[citation needed].&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;B2B white papers are long-form content designed to promote the products or services from a specific company. As a marketing tool, these papers use selected facts and logical arguments to build a case favorable to the company sponsoring the document. B2B white papers are often used to generate sales leads, establish thought leadership, make a business case, or inform and persuade prospective customers, channel partners, journalists, analysts, or investors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Many B2B white papers argue that one particular technology, product or method is superior for solving a specific business problem. They may also present research findings, list a set of questions or tips about a certain business issue, or highlight a particular product or service from a vendor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;">

He taught me category theory. As far as I remember none of us had ever any problems with his regular mini-skirt outfit. In my graduate institution there was a graduate student who changed gender and made it known to everybody (faculty and students). Again, there were no issues that I've heard of, the relationship of that person with their supervisor remained very good (as far as I can tell) and the person went on to a very good job later on. Keep in mind that I did my undergraduate and graduate degree in fairly &quot;liberal&quot; places. Overall my experience was that if you let people know, but then move on with you regular life then it doesn't become an issue. Also it is not unlikely that some of your colleagues already &quot;know&quot;. I guess there is always an amount of risk involved with full disclosure. Keep in mind that people shouldn't judge you on what you do in your private time. Another factor is if you already have tenure, and if you don't and things go bad if you will try to explain them by your transition?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

Most of our MS applications are rejected without review.  But that's as far as grades and test scores will get you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since you claim not to come from an IIT or NIT, there might be some question about how good your university is.  If we've never admitted someone from your school before, we don't know how to calibrate your grades or recommendation letters.  Every year we seem to get applications from two or three new schools in India that even our Indian faculty and graduate students don't recognize.  We do sometimes admit one or two &lt;em&gt;truly outstanding&lt;/em&gt; students from unknown schools as a way of gathering data.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Having an internship is definitely good, especially if you did something creative and independent, and not just &quot;My boss told me to implement this thing, so I did.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But the admission decision would really depend on your research statement (or &quot;statement of purpose&quot;) and your recommendation letters.

My committee would judge that potential from the content of your statements and letters, and from the credibility of your letter-writers.  Research &lt;em&gt;experience&lt;/em&gt; is certainly helpful, but it's not necessary, especially for an MS.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is really an question for your letter writers.&lt;/strong&gt;  Ask them directly if they can write strong and substantial letters &lt;em&gt;that focus on your research potential&lt;/em&gt;.  If they look uncomfortable (or they don't know what &quot;research potential&quot; means), you should probably aim a bit lower.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

It would be even more challenging to move your project over, if funding isn't available to work on the same project.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since you are just starting, perhaps it would be possible to complete a master's degree in Singapore, and then try to transfer to another university for the doctoral studies.

That question specifically asked how one can succeed in obtaining researcher's source code. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As discussed in the answers to that question, the reasons largely boil down to competitive advantage and people thinking their code is not good enough. The former issue is difficult to address. However, one could try to address the latter issue, making the reasonable assumption that this behavior stems from the surrounding academic culture. There may be additional aspects of the academic culture that discourage code sharing, and which do not relate to competitive advantage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, one could instead ask the general questions what concrete actions one can take to change this culture?

Academics are as rational agents as any, and currently the academic system (mainly publish/get grants or perish) provides little &lt;strong&gt;incentive&lt;/strong&gt; to publishing the code or making analysis entirely reproducible. Some fields have started intiatives to encourage this by making either analysis and publicly releasing data mandatory or strongly recommended for publication (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ucema.edu.ar/journal-applied-economics&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The Journal of Applied Economics&lt;/a&gt;) or for funding (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nij.gov/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;NIJ&lt;/a&gt; grants frequently have stipulations to post the data to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/landing.jsp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;ICPSR&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Greater awareness of technical computing skills necessary for reproducible analysis will help (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.econ.uiuc.edu/~roger/research/repro/JAE-RER.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Koeneker &amp;amp; Zeileis, 2009&lt;/a&gt;), but on its own won't spurn greater compliance, even if the already discussed negatives are largely mitigated.

How do you change the culture of a field?  Very slowly, and only with enormous effort.  You talk to other researchers.  You articulate your values, and seek allies who share your values.  You patiently make the case to your fellow colleagues, perhaps by writing opinion pieces.  You don't harangue or attack them; instead, you gently lay out the reasons why it is good for science and good for them to share their code.  Remember, in all likelihood you all share the same common values: the love and dedication of science and the pursuit of truth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You lead, by acting as a model for how you would like others to behave.  You do what &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; think is right, and set a good example.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You try to persuade referees and program committees to value and reward researchers who do share their source code.  Recognize the amount of extra effort this takes, and (if you believe it is valuable) reward it accordingly: bump up your rating of their paper correspondingly, and make the case why others to do so.  When you write letters of reference or evaluation for another researcher, if they share their source code, give them kudos and explain why the hiring or promotion committee should view this positively.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, this is not something that a single individual can change.  Only the entire community, acting as a whole, can make this kind of change.  Individuals can catalyze and facilitate that change, but like any other kind of reform, it takes extraordinary patience and effort, as well as buy-in from your colleagues.  It's not unusual for this kind of change to take a generation or two.  But keep your chin up: remember, you're doing this because you believe it is good for science and good for your field!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

When I write some to simulate an experiment or an algorithm to verify numerically the result of a calculation, it is not production-ready code that can be  easily run in another environment: at the very least another researcher needs Matlab or Mathematica, they need whatever special toolboxes or auxiliary code I am using, they need the data files in the right place on the hard drive, they need to understand how to program themselves so that when some small glitch arises, they can deal with it. When I try to run my own code from a year ago, it almost needs some massaging: perhaps a needed file has been moved from one directory to another, perhaps a toolbox has had its code base &quot;updated&quot; and no longer works exactly the same way. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So -- here's what usually happens. Someone contacts me and wants to try out my code. I warn them of all the above issues, but they insist that they know what they are doing and will get back to me with any problems. I spend 2 or 3 hours preparing things, checking stuff out so that they will have an easier time, explaining to them how to put things together so that it will all work. I mail it to them. And I never hear back. It happened again last month. So -- how likely am I to &quot;share&quot; code in the future? Just a little bit less likely than last month. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now to the question: how can you get researchers to share their code? First, when you ask, follow through - don't &quot;take the code and disappear.&quot; Second, try to get the researcher interested in &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; you want the code, what you might do with it. Third, the burden is on you to take research-style code (poorly commented, bad error checking, disorganized structure) and to make it do something. Fourth, return something: when you do make some progress, let the researcher know. Fifth, don't ask for impossible things: can I compile the code for your machine (that's different from mine)? (Hint: no). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

While I meant the question to be what one can do to change the culture towards a more sharing culture in a general way, you make good points. One comment - if you are sharing your code with one individual by email, why not make it generally available via hosting sites like github or bitbucket? I think one issue that is not clear is - is it reasonable to publish ones code as is (meaning, put it on github etc.), even if one does not consider its quality suitable for third parties? If so, this would presumably come with an explicit disavowal of any support burden./>

Same goes for fonts and line styles. Also, if you're going to use blue squares to represent some &lt;em&gt;thing&lt;/em&gt; in a figure, be sure to use blue squares for nothing else throughout your entire paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conciseness&lt;/strong&gt;: Try to reduce each figure to making a single point, i.e. try to think in terms of &quot;what is this figure trying to say&quot;. It's tempting to pack more and more data into a single figure, but in the end this will usually dilute the message. One figure, one statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clarity&lt;/strong&gt;: Once you've decided what it is that your figure will say, remove anything from it that does not contribute to this single statement. E.g. do you really need every data point/curve you've drawn? If your statement refers to part of a flow chart or class diagram, do you really need all the other, less relevant boxes/labels/methods there too? Also, if the salient feature of your figure is not immediately clear, don't shy away from adding an arrow or something to highlight it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Completeness&lt;/strong&gt;: Holding the balance to clarity's minimalism, make sure there is also nothing &lt;em&gt;missing&lt;/em&gt; from the figure which is needed for the statement you want to make. Figure axes labels are a favourite. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Funny how they all start with &quot;C&quot;. This is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; intentional.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

This may seem very obvious but there are many pitfalls and Tufte provides good examples and ways to think about even simple graphics. Design issues such as fonts, line weight, color etc. and thinking about what it is that should be conveyed in a graphic helps to understand how to design efficient graphics. There is a defintion of graphical excellence by Tufte that says that an illustration that provides the reader with as many thoughts as possible in as short a time as possible by using as little ink as possible consitutes such excellence. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Obviously it is impossible to provide a full answer here particularly since it would repeat what is already in print. My personal view is that the book mentioned above is a good foundation to start critically view and discuss illustrations you encounter. Discussing with peers can be very useful. At the same time there is also much tradition in graphics so new ideas may not necessarily fall into fertile soil rigt away.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

For example, according to their &lt;a href=&quot;http://portal.acs.org/portal/PublicWebSite/about/aboutacs/financial/CNBP_032302&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;financial statement&lt;/a&gt;, in 2012 the American Chemical Society received $421 million in revenue for electronic services, including both journals and the Chemical Abstracts Service.  That's a staggering amount of money for a scholarly society.  (For comparison, the American Mathematical Society's &lt;a href=&quot;http://portal.acs.org/portal/PublicWebSite/about/aboutacs/financial/CNBP_032302&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;2011 revenue&lt;/a&gt; from Math Reviews and journals was $15.5 million.)  The ACS is the gatekeeper for publications and data that are worth a fortune to industry, so they have a powerful incentive to maintain that control.  It's no coincidence that they are much less friendly towards open access, the arXiv, etc. than corresponding groups in mathematics or physics are.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

This hurts those other applicants.  It is also a serious inconvenience to the department's admissions committee, as they need to meet their enrollment targets as closely as possible; failure to do so can affect their funding, and in extreme cases, the survival of the graduate program.  So this is at least inconsiderate on your part, and arguably unethical.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the institutions find out that you have done this, it is possible that they may rescind their acceptances; this is uncommon but has been known to happen.  In addition, you would certainly forfeit any deposits that you paid.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the undergraduate level, where deposits are almost always required (in the US), this practice is called &quot;double depositing&quot;.  The National Association for College Admission Counseling, in their &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nacacnet.org/research/PublicationsResources/Marketplace/Documents/GCAP2011_Web.pdf&quot;&gt;Guide to the College Admission Process&lt;/a&gt;&quot;, says:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Colleges view dual or multiple deposits by students&#xA;  as serious violations of trust and may revoke a previous&#xA;  offer of admission from any student who is found to have&#xA;  sent tuition deposits to more than one college.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My advice is this: at this point, you should plan on attending the university X to which you've announced your intent.  However, if you are absolutely convinced that doing so would be a &lt;em&gt;huge mistake&lt;/em&gt; (not merely that you think Y is a little bit better), then you could contact the admissions committee at X, explain your reasons, apologize, and ask to be released from your agreement.  If you do this, you should do it as soon as possible (ideally within days - don't stew about it for two weeks), and know that it will probably burn your bridges with X, as well as forfeiting your deposit.  If X says it's all right (they probably will - if you don't want to be there, they don't want you there), then you could send your intent to Y.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some people might argue that you are also ethically obligated to inform Y of the situation.  I think it's kind of a gray area, myself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You might also discuss the matter with an advisor or other professor at your current institution.  They might offer some perspective on X that would help reassure you.  In general, most people say that it isn't so crucial which institution you attend, within reason - your own skills and motivation are a much greater factor in your success.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

<answer QuestionId="Journals selection - alternative criteria to impact factor" AnswerId="pa5B6H8EJilQ8Enfm56hnQ==" Author="4394" Date="2013-07-30T15:28:51.377" Score="5" Text="&lt;p&gt;Many good suggestions have been given in the answers by Benoît Kloeckner and Dikran Marsupial. I would like to add to these answers by including the following.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most journals are fairly specialized. The impact factor (IF) tells us how much a given paper published in a specific is referenced on average. So although it may be important to publish in high IF journals it is also (I would say more) important to make sure the paper is seen and read. A high IF journal ensures that this happens to some extent. But, sometimes ones subdiscipline is poorly represented in such a journal and it may turn out that a lower ranked journal may be the major outlet for papers in the discipline. Knowing where people publish their papers is therefore a good guide to the palette or possiblities. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, take a careful look at where papers you refer to are published and try to assess where your &quot;audience&quot; is likely to look. Such journals are also likely to provide very good insightful reviews. So when you look at journals try to look at your possibilities from all directions and assess the best journal based on all of the suggestions made in the answers here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

This means the &quot;submitted&quot; date on the published paper is the date of the submission of the &lt;em&gt;accepted&lt;/em&gt; version, not the initial submission of the paper.  I personally think this is unethical and no longer review for journals that have this policy as I think it is unfair on the authors, firstly because it deceives them into thinking the journal has a more rapid review process than it actually does, but more importantly because it deprives the authors on priority on their discovery.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So as well as IF, I would say that the review process is a factor to consider.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A good way to choose a journal is to see where the leading figures in your field publish their papers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

Having used a few different learning management systems (Canvas, Moodle, Blackboard, homegrown stuff), I can tell you that this is rarely true. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The people resistant to change are probably resisting because they've seen different incarnations of this technology come and go, and find it annoying to have to keep learning a new system &lt;em&gt;that doesn't present any significant advantages over what they're doing&lt;/em&gt;. The &lt;em&gt;significant&lt;/em&gt; part is important. There's a cost to making a change, so the new system can't just be as good. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I'll add to Chris's excellent suggestions as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;make it seamless not just to import, but to &lt;strong&gt;export&lt;/strong&gt; easily. In the world of online software, it's important not to have things be gated. I want assurances that if your new system goes away tomorrow, to be replaced by the next new system, that I can easily transfer material from the old system to the new with a few clicks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;demonstrate why this new system isn't going away in a year to be replaced by something else. How you do that is up to you and depends on the system you're pushing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bottom line: the perceived attitude in the question is that the faculty are at fault for not adopting new technology, but the truth is that most new tech is crappy and short-lived, and it's natural to want to wait things out. So you have convince people that the new approach is not crappy and will last. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

If it is hard to do, or if it takes a particular skill other than &quot;go to this website and click a few links&quot; than you're going to have a hard time ever convincing them to get onboard.  If they absolutely need to be trained, you may have to have a mandatory training session where they get their first set of lectures or whatever online (but don't expect any other forthcoming material to be posted without more prodding--then again, they may see the light if it is easy enough and they can see the results online).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'd suggest one or more of the following four suggestions, in order of preference:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ask for student volunteers to help these faculty put their material online.  Whether these are TAs for the class, or paid/hired students not already assigned, or strictly volunteers is up to you and budgeting concerns.  You may have to continue this process for subsequent classes if the faculty aren't willing to learn how to do it themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Automate the system (which goes back to my original comment).  If paper is involved, have someone set up a scanner to handle loose-leaf material, or via a photocopier/scanner.  If it is just soft-copy document uploading, this can be automated with a drop box on a shared drive -- just drag materials into the box and it ends up online.  This won't make for a particularly organized system, but at least the material will be online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wait them out and let attrition work its magic.  You may always have reluctant faculty, but as older Luddites retire you should find this less of a problem.  If there are only a few faculty that don't want to come onboard, this is definitely the easiest method, and you're really not losing too much by waiting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make posting the material mandatory.  I can almost guarantee this won't be possible for tenured faculty, but maybe you can provide some incentive rather than simply encouraging them to put the material online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't think you'll get very far with a simple plea for coming into the 21st Century -- if they are refusing to adopt, they probably feel they are too busy, or don't like the whole idea of it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

That said, some of the larger graduate departments may receive several hundred applications per year, and it may be necessary to do a preliminary screening before deciding which applications will be examined in further detail. However, what gets through such a screen can vary strongly from school to school and department to department. For instance, if you're at a school whose alumni regularly go on to graduate schools and have a track record of success, that can also be a &quot;plus&quot; factor. If you're near the top of your class, that can also mitigate &quot;weak&quot; grades somewhat (because it indicates that your school resists grade inflation). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would hope that graduate admissions flag applications with publications listed, but it depends on whether or not the database reports that summarize applications actually can do a screen for the presence of publications. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your specific case, however, is unfortunately in the &quot;no man's land&quot;—not a clear &quot;read no matter what,&quot; but also not an automatic &quot;throw away,&quot; either.

The senate functions as a voice of the faculty&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By filtering and focusing the concerns of the faculty, the senate functions as a key voice of the faculty.  A voice selected or elected by departments across the campus. The senate can conduct dialog with the administration, offer press releases, lobby with legislators, join in with other institutions to tackle larger issues... Whether or not they are listened to, faculty member should speak together often about the central issues at the institution.   &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B. Determination of General Educational Policy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Traditionally the senate allows the different disciplines to discuss joint concerns, such as the general education policy, starting new programs, ...

Aside from actual published research, the most compelling evidence is a strong letter from a well-known active researcher, who writes about your research potential in specific and credible detail, based on direct personal interaction.  To get those letters, you need to engage with professors as a &lt;em&gt;potential colleague&lt;/em&gt;, not just as a &lt;em&gt;student&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yes, take advanced and graduate-level math classes, but don't &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; sit in the back and quietly get As.

It's therefore mostly anecdotal and should be taken lightly!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REUs:&lt;/strong&gt; Try to do as many as you can! You get to meet other people who like math, learn new stuff, practice struggling with research, travel a bit, and get some cash to boot. They also, of course, look good on applications. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Publications:&lt;/strong&gt; I don't personally have any publications. I wrote a few papers during my REUs and projects, but they were only published on the REU websites. So they're not necessary to get in. However, I did have a great deal of trouble getting acceptances. Maybe a publication would have helped, but I think it's very rare for an undergraduate to actually publish a paper.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Graduate Courses:&lt;/strong&gt; I took several of these as an undergraduate. I enjoyed them, but realize now that I should have taken them a little more seriously! I've forgotten a great deal of what I saw in them. However, I have noticed that I'm quite strong in the area I took graduate courses in compared to my peers. So they definitely give you an edge! However, don't become too obsessed with loading up with graduate courses. Three of them is quite a lot of work, if you give them justice. Since most graduate courses are graded very lightly, you can make high marks in them without putting forth as much effort as you would in an undergraduate course! (At least, this was how it worked at my undergraduate institution.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That said, keep in mind that some of your time in college should be spent having fun, too. Don't become a math robot just yet! You have time for that in grad school. :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reading Textbooks:&lt;/strong&gt; The fact you're already reading the &quot;core&quot; undergraduate books before even entering the university puts you far, far ahead of the curve. Many people won't learn those things until sophomore or junior year. I certainly didn't. Make sure you're doing the bulk of the exercises in those books, especially Rudin. Try to prove statements you come across without looking at their proofs. I feel that this is where most of the learning happens. You can easily read things and not understand them, so just watch out! Other than that, finish those books and then you should be set to take the advanced undergraduate/first year graduate courses at your institution.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Math Subject GRE:&lt;/strong&gt; I hate this thing and did very poorly on it. You'll blow the math portion of the general GRE out of the water. It's easy stuff for any math major. However, if you don't spend a little time reviewing, you can really mess up the subject test, since it's timed and covers things you might not have thought about for several years. The topics are almost completely disjoint from what a student taking graduate courses has been doing. Look at a few practice tests, identify what sorts of questions are asked, and train yourself to quickly answer such questions. Speed is key. You don't want the subject GRE to be a weak point on your application, especially since it's an easily prevented weak point.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, do REUs, take graduate courses, don't sweat not having publications (but if you can get some do), and study for the subject GRE!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

<answer QuestionId="Path to a good grad school" AnswerId="bhpyNV5GgyrIPqIwlYqmBA==" Author="user7628" Date="2013-07-06T16:55:47.273" Score="3" Text="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some advice first:&lt;/strong&gt; Ultimately you may change your mind about what you want to do in your academic life (and you probably will, which is to be expected) so what I would do is make sure I have a back-up plan. By &quot;back-up plan&quot; I mean whatever field you may choose, make sure it coincides with another existing field (in some obvious, explicit way). That way, if you do end up hating say analytic number theory and you want to specialize in algebraic geometry instead, the path would be continuous, and you wouldn't face too many rough patches. Since you're passionate about math, I'm assuming you have a very, very rough idea of what you may want to specialize in grad school (applied math seems out the window). If not, that's okay. You've got years to think about that. If the answer is yes, then in addition to the core classes (abstract algebra, points-set topology, real analysis are the norm), you should self-study additional books that pertain to your field of interest. If you like number theory, start with Alan Baker's book. If you like geometry, start with Pedoe's book. And so on and so forth. In the meanwhile I'll give you an outline of what I think is the &quot;Ideal&quot; student's path towards a top grad school (for these purposes, I'm going to say all of the schools in the top 10 programs). This will be completely subjective of course, so disclaimer: don't get on my case. I'm also going to completely ignore the general education requirements and just focus on the math part. Since I'm not a believer in REUs I won't mention anything about that. I don't think they're a good reflection of research ability because not too many of them are exceptional. (i.e no first authorship. No grad school is going to believe you made progress on the Hodge conjecture if you say that on your personal statement. You'd only be BS'ing yourself). Moving on :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Freshman year&lt;/strong&gt;: Get your core classes over with. You'll probably be able to finish half of them in this time assuming you declare your major this early and you petition your academic adviser to take more than what the norm is (and if you can prove your competency in the subjects you've listed). They may be able to waive the prerequisites and make an exception for you. In the meanwhile, don't be a stool in class and just get A's. Ask and answer questions regarding your coursework. Go beyond that and take advantage of your professors' office hours. Don't worry if you think you're intruding: it's part of the job description, and they'll probably like the enthusiasm. Talk to them about doing research (it's definitely &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; too early) in an area of interest. Provide your relevant mathematical background so that they may guide you. Ask them what other professors you should talk to if you want to do undergrad research in X, Y, or Z. Collect as much information and ask as many questions as possible. In the meanwhile, maintain a consistent average (3.8+ would probably be favorable). If all goes well, you should be able to get started (or at least have a topic and someone to work with) by the beginning of your sophomore year. If you wanna have fun, you should take the Putnam exam (I don't know how relevant scores are to grad admissions) and see how well you do. If you somehow become a Putnam Fellow, that's going to significantly increase your chances (for bureaucracy reasons probably since the Putnam exam and research mathematics require different tool sets). Still, you can only take this exam a maximum of 4 times in your undergrad years (once for every year). So I'd take advantage of that. If your university has an honors program that results in a senior thesis, I'd take advantage of that as well. Sometimes very exceptional theses get published in journals and that'd be a good credential to have.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sophomore year&lt;/strong&gt;: By the end of this year you should be well done by your core requirements (assuming you're persistent and keep petitioning to take more and more credit hours). More importantly, at the end of this year you should have a very rough idea of what you may want to study in grad school. But it should be more concise than whatever you're thinking about now. At this point you should also think about starting at least 2 more research projects (the reason is, you need at most 3 letters of recommendation for places like Princeton). If you can get 3 letters of rec. from professors who know you well (i.e the ones you worked with in your 3 research projects) that'll look very favorably on your application. Once again, take the Putnam. Maintain your GPA as close to a 4.0 as possible. You know, the usual.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Junior year&lt;/strong&gt;: Now would be a good time to start taking grad-level classes. Try to coincide these classes with your area of interest. If you like algebraic geometry, take a class on that and see how you like it. You should know the drill by now. If you're still working on these projects (and you probably will be) don't lose focus. If a publication seems like a pipe dream, that's okay. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Publications are not expected of undergrads&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. But it would look great of course. If you have not already, you should think about which grad schools you may want to apply to. Again, maintain that high GPA and take the Putnam to ease your sure to be troubled mind. By the end of Junior year, you should start studying for the GRE and the GRE Subject test. If you happen to have done extremely well on the Putnam (i.e became a Putnam Fellow or scored in the top 100) you'll probably find the studying part trivial as you've had much practice with problem solving and adeptness. Of course don't get cocky: you should still review anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Senior year&lt;/strong&gt;: Take the GRE and the GRE Subject test. Kick ass at them. Try to finish up your 3 research projects if you have not already and prepare to submit them to a peer-reviewed journal. The process may take time so don't be discouraged if you're still not finished by the time you apply. Be sure to do well on your senior thesis as well assuming your university offers them. Get those amazing letters of rec. from the 3 - 4 year relationship you've established with your professors. Go overload on those grad classes (or self-study) and work at optimum. Get acquainted with your potential field. After all is said and done, write up your CV, do your applications, and send them in. After that, take a sigh of relief, put up your feet, and relax. Take the Putnam for the final time. Enjoy your remaining months in college before you're off doing your PhD.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If all goes well, you'll get published, you'll get praised, and you'll get into your schools of choice.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

But these were two problems: 1) There were too many small mistakes so at least one of them slided my attention. 2) I couldn't ask the copy-editor to remove a whole &quot;sentence&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If I had the chance to revise it, I would easily fix that up.

But on the other hand am afraid that it would make my paper look not-perfect or even ugly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Do you suggest me sending a corrigendum? Or should I wait until someone notices that and writes a letter to the editor and then I answer in a reply to that letter, saying that &quot;yes you are right, that sentence should not be there in the first place&quot;?

The guideline, for example, given by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apsstylemanual.org/formattingAPSJournalArticles/corrigendum.htm&quot;&gt;American Physiological Society&lt;/a&gt; is:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;if the author determines that it is scientifically necessary&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/authors/policies/corrections.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; uses the following definition for a corrigendum:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Corrigendum.&lt;/em&gt; Notification of an important error made by the author(s) that affects the publication record or the scientific integrity of the paper, or the reputation of the authors or the journal. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unless the venue in which you published your work states otherwise in their publication guidelines, a stray sentence that is not factually false, does not invalidate your claims, and does not impinge on the efforts of other researchers to reproduce your work is likely not &quot;scientifically necessary.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even if you insist on perfection, you should also be aware how corrigenda are viewed by other researchers in your field. If in your field the prevailing view is that corrigenda are used for &quot;scientifically necessary&quot; changes to your article, then you need to be prepared to answer questions about your correction in the future (usually of the form, &quot;Why is there a corrigendum issued for your paper? Are you &lt;em&gt;sure&lt;/em&gt; it doesn't change your conclusions?&quot;) &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, a minor point is that if you published in a journal which charges publication fees, quite often your corrigendum will come with a not-so-small price-tag also. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

It's like introducing yourself before you ask an academic you don't know a question one-on-one over coffee at a conference – sometimes there's no need, but sometimes it's essential to framing the question &amp;amp; making the most of the other person's time &amp;amp; answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have never been explicitly asked for a biography beyond &quot;how do you know the candidate, for how long, and in what capacity&quot;.  However, the UK is under a lot of legal pressure concerning letters of reference because some are so much better than others, not necessarily due to the candidate, but possibly due to how knowledgeable the writer is about writing letters.  Possibly candidates deserve some credit for picking good letter writers, but this could be hard particularly for very junior candidates.  So  having guidance for writing a letter is useful, it's letting all letter writers know good practice by previous letter writers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Personally I include biographical information (not a full biography) where I think it may be helpful and when I am trying to write a strong letter. Similarly, I also give information about our institution where I think it might not be known and be helpful.   Examples: if I am writing a US institution from the UK, I let them know that I have attended US institutions &amp;amp; know what their programmes are like. Sometimes if I know someone well in the department I may point that out in the letter so that whoever is doing the search has the option of going to ask that person how seriously to take my opinion if they want to.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I put this at the end of the first paragraph or possibly as a stand-alone second paragraph, in advance of offering my verbose opinion of the candidate, so that the reader can have that information in mind when they see what my opinion is. The first sentence of the first paragraph says who the letter is for &amp;amp; for what position.  The second sentence is my one-sentence summary of my recommendation. The third (or the second paragraph) is in what capacity I am writing the letter.  That's where biographical details might be useful. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

The GRE subject test is very iffy, in a variety of aspects. Thus, the ideal circumstance is coursework &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; self-study, to have certifiable conventional (&quot;passive&quot;) education as well as demonstrating initiative and interest. Further, very often the available undergrad curriculum really doesn't prepare people for grad school, so I'd strongly recommend substantial self-study in any case. Perhaps best under the aegis of math faculty who can provide some certification in letters of recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The thing that &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be missing from self-study, if that's all one has as mathematics background, is the &quot;regular drill&quot; on basic reflexes that, in any case, routine coursework does cultivate. If one has to stop and think too much, the slowdown/cognitive-load can make routine things effectively impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, beware, the usual first year-or-two of math grad school include &quot;routine&quot; coursework and exams that do presume a &quot;standard&quot; undergrad background, including routine drill on a fairly standard body of material. With an extremely thin or idiosyncratic background, one must play a lot of catch-up. This can have several bad effects: may give the impression of incapability, may make you tired and discouraged, may stifle natural interest. So &quot;brace yourself&quot; if that's the path you find yourself on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

If that's the case, I'm curious why you don't use the most useful searchable database, namely &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.google.com/&lt;/a&gt; Depending on how much information you have (and possibly how proficient in the target languages), you'll eventually be able to identify them in their native languages unless you're talking about very obscure or older-than-the-internet authors. Since the authors you want to identify wrote something in foreign languages, I think chances are they have personal or official websites that have their names both in Latin alphabet and in their native languages. If they don't, you may find some pages that help you identify them in their native languages.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't get why you think a database on literature is particularly useful for that purpose either. You can use any available resource. For instance, if the authors you want to identify are active Japanese researchers, you can search them in one of the researcher databases found here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://read.jst.go.jp/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://read.jst.go.jp/&lt;/a&gt; (in Japanese) &lt;a href=&quot;http://read.jst.go.jp/index_e.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://read.jst.go.jp/index_e.html&lt;/a&gt; (in English). (The English version is the first hit on google for &quot;japanese researcher database&quot; by the way. You'd run into these sites very frequently if you google Japanese researchers, too.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, as an example, assume you want to know, say, the Japanese spelling of my former Ph.D. supervisor Masakazu Jimbo at Nagoya University. And you want to avoid navigating the internet in Japanese as much as possible while searching. Then, you go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://researchmap.jp/?lang=english&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the English version of Read &amp;amp; Researchmap&lt;/a&gt;, click &quot;Researcher Search&quot; to get to &lt;a href=&quot;http://researchmap.jp/search/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the researcher search page&lt;/a&gt;, and do the usual search with the information you have (i.e., the name is spelled Masakazu Jimbo and he's at Nagoya University). You'll be directed to &lt;a href=&quot;http://researchmap.jp/read0164386&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;his information in English&lt;/a&gt;. Then you switch to &lt;a href=&quot;http://researchmap.jp/read0164386/?lang=japanese&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the original Japanese page&lt;/a&gt; by clicking 日本語 to check how to spell his name in Japanese.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, you don't need to use the Read &amp;amp; Researchmap to know his name in Japanese. You can simply google him. If you know publication titles and his name in Latin alphabet, you can surely locate his personal website, where you can see how to spell his name in Japanese.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Exactly what kind of situation are you in? You talk about literature, so I assumed you wanted to cite/quote works by Chinese and/or Japanese authors. And you say those works are not in their native languages, which, I assume, means that you know more about the authors than just their transliterated names (unless you're trying to cite/quote them without reading them). Was the additional information you have not enough to identify them through google? Are libraries' databases and such on books etc. really the only kind you can identify them with what you already know about them? Maybe, they're from 19th centuries or something or way too obscure for the internet to be of use? Or is this question &quot;What resources can I use to find out the correct characters for their names?&quot; asked as a very very broad inquiry for Internet Search 101? If that's the case, it's too broad to answer because you don't tell us what you already know about the authors and why you can't identify them through usual means like google.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

However, in general, one important distinction can usually be cited: you must be a &lt;em&gt;professional&lt;/em&gt; researcher (as opposed to a student or trainee) to be eligible to submit a direct grant. Students would normally need to have their advisors submit the grant proposals on their behalf. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You need to consult the specific rules of the grant you're interested in applying for. Moreover, if you are at an institution that often applies for grants, you should check with the local grants administration office for more guidance. They may have internal policies regarding for whom they will submit grants.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is also important to note that different countries and different agencies have varying standards. Here in Germany, for instance, you &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; have the equivalent of a doctoral degree to be eligible to be the coordinating Principal Investigator of a proposal. You can participate as a team member without a doctoral degree, but not be a principal investigator.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

Right now you are reacting: you are letting your emotions control your reactions.  Instead, you should figure out what end goal you want to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Do you want to make sure that the paper is in good enough shape, before it is sent to the Dean?  Then negotiate a timeline with your co-authors.  This might mean you both have to give a little: you might have to work extra hard to get your revisions in; and they might have to be willing to delay sending the paper a little bit until you've all had a chance to revise to your satisfaction.  That's a perfectly reasonable request.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Do you want to be listed as first author?  If so, why?  You said the paper is not going to be published.  So why do you care?  If you think your contribution means it is appropriate for you to be first author, and you care about it, then raise the point with your co-author.  But approach it with humility and gentleness.  Remember that we're human; we have a tendency to overestimate our own contribution and underestimate others, so you need to correct for that.  Also, definitely do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; ask to be first author as a way of getting revenge; that is petty and beneath you.  Take the high road.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And, take this as a lesson.  Generally, it is best to discuss authorship early in the project, not wait until the very end.  In my collaborations, there is often an understanding from the start about who is the lead on the project; the expectation is that the lead has the overall responsibility and will most likely put in the most work, and in return will likely end up as first author.  These discussions about authorship are often easier to happen earlier than later.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, bottom line: Figure out what you want to achieve (what you want the end state to look like).  Then, figure out how to ask for that.  Set aside your emotions and your negative reactions to your co-author's initiative in moving things forward without checking with you first, and focus on what end state you want to achieve.  I suspect you might find that you share pretty much the same goals as your co-author, and there's no need to get upset or strain your relations with her.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

We had young children at that point, and he spent two years as a lecturer, applied for hundreds of jobs, and finally took a tenure-track job at a teaching university. Now, he honestly believes that a research position is impossible for him.  He loves to teach, but hates the endless grind of &quot;administrivia&quot;, the low pay, and the mental laziness of the students he's required to teach. (I wish I could give more details, but his research area was a fairly small community, and I don't want to give any aspect of his identity away.) &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I hate watching this brilliant man say things like, &quot;Well, since I didn't get a post-doc, I'm stuck on this path, and there's nothing I can do to get out of it.&quot;  I hate watching him spiral into depression.  I am insisting on him getting counseling, but he refuses to take anyone's encouragement that other jobs are possible, saying things like, &quot;You just don't know the academic world.  If I go to the NSA, no one will hire me in an academic position.  If I become an actuary (because we do need more money) then all of my time will be sucked into studying for exams, and I still won't be able to do research.&quot; In his mind, no one in our circle of loved ones has the authority or experience to give him accurate encouragement.  So I'm looking to anonymous strangers at this point. :(  Is a research position possible after spending time at a teaching university?

My husband's eyes lit up after seeing that 1) This was a fairly common problem, and not somehow indicative of his skill level;  2) There were solutions, other than being miserable; and 3) The solutions did not a) condemn him to a life of administrivia, or b) require him to leave academia all together.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After getting the &lt;em&gt;hope&lt;/em&gt; he needed from you guys, he spoke with a mentor of his from undergrad, and was given incredibly specific guidance on where to go from here.  His teaching load is so heavy, (4/4 or 4/3) and the mentor gave him a few places to apply to in his field where the teaching load is more conducive to &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; research, but is not at a research-specific university.   (3/3 or even 3/2!!!) He plans on speaking to his advisor, getting some &lt;em&gt;glowing&lt;/em&gt; letters of recommendation, and starting a job search soon.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thanks so much.

<answer QuestionId="Is it possible to recover after a career setback such as this" AnswerId="eMnNalNnufZA6axjXTAlJA==" Author="705" Date="2013-06-02T06:09:14.580" Score="14" Text="&lt;p&gt;I'm going to disagree a little bit with the other answers.  This is a frustrating situation.  Unfortunately, as Anonymous stated, the number of qualified mathematicians exceeds the number of academic research positions.  This makes a difficult position.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I fear your husband might have accurately assessed the situation.  While I appreciate the suggestion others made of continuing to do research on his own time, this is very difficult.  If you have a full-time non-research position and a family, that doesn't leave a lot of time for research -- so it's very hard to sustain a level of research output that will be competitive with the competition.  Also, others who do have a research faculty position may have students and collaborators, which further boosts their research output; your husband won't have that advantage.  So, while in principle your husband could continue research on his own time to try to build a research portfolio in hopes that this leads to a tenure-track academic research position, in practice your husband is at a disadvantage.  He would be climbing up a steep hill.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My suggestion would be for him to get advice from someone more senior who he respects.  Is it worth his time for him to continue his research on his own time, and continue applying to hundreds of research positions each year for the next few years?  Maybe, or maybe it's a waste of time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, perhaps he might consider other career alternatives.  Rather than being entirely set on an academic research position, maybe he should consider other career paths.  Even if he has his mind set on an academic research position right now, I suspect there are a number of other directions where he could be happy.  Maybe he should consider the actuarial path, or consider a NSA job?  Or consider Wall Street (a job in the financial sector)?  Maybe he could teach himself computer programming on his own time and pursue a job in the computing industry?  Perhaps there are other opportunities.  This kind of change is scary and requires some courage, which is undoubtedly especially difficult when you are depressed: your support will undoubtedly be helpful to him.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A third option is to find things to love in his current teaching position.  I certainly sympathize with the trials; they are real, and a drag, to be sure.  On the other hand, there's a lot to love about teaching, too.  You get to help young students discover the beauty of mathematics: even if it's just one out of a class of 30 students who finds a real passion, that can be very satisfying and rewarding.  Unfortunately, the administrivia and the laziness of students is a constant in academia and would probably be present even if he found a research position; the trick with dealing with them is to find other things in his life that are rewarding and satisfying, and focus on them.  For instance, perhaps he might enjoy doing math research in his own time, not with the goal or any illusions that it will lead to any research position, but entirely for its own sake: for the love and pleasure and beauty of it.  Or maybe he might offer to set up a special enrichment seminar or program for students who do love math to learn more: maybe run a program to prepare for the Putnam exam or Math Olympiad.  If he offers to do this on his own time, as an overload, I imagine his department chair would jump at the opportunity, and it might provide a chance to do something rewarding and fulfilling for him and be a great inspiration to a few students.  Or maybe he might find something else in his job that is rewarding and worth doing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

The NSA and actuarial work are both options still on the table.  When the post-doc didn't go through, his advisor offered to connect him to someone in the financial sector.  The truth is that he does have lots of options.  I think the worst thing he's had to deal with is a lack of credible information on whether the research option was dead or not.  Thank you./>

<answer QuestionId="Is it possible to recover after a career setback such as this" AnswerId="Eeb62N/tc+gPgr+MotGuqQ==" Author="612" Date="2013-06-02T06:22:08.413" Score="45" Text="&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Is a research position possible after spending time at a teaching university? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yes, it's possible.  There's a mild stigma to applying from a teaching university, since it advertises lack of success getting a research job in the past.  Because of the high ratio of candidates to positions, academic hiring is often risk averse and the perception that nobody else wants a candidate will worry search committees.  However, this can be overcome.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One thing to keep in mind is that the past difficulties could simply have been bad luck.  Even very strong candidates typically do not get many job offers, and bad luck can easily change &quot;a few&quot; into &quot;zero&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's possible to strengthen one's application by writing additional papers, but this generally requires &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; papers or more papers &lt;em&gt;per year&lt;/em&gt;, since search committees will normalize for time: if you've spent longer they will expect more.  However, the focus is more on the future than the past.  If you have a productive few years and show signs of maintaining that productivity in the future, it can make up for fallow periods in the past.  If you quit publishing, then the chances of a research job will rapidly drop to zero until you resume publishing.  (There are a lot of people who would like to do research but aren't prepared to actually do it, since they aren't up on the current research literature.  You can't get a research job unless you demonstrate that you aren't one of these people.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In an ideal world, search committees would also normalize for the applicants' circumstances.  For example, research productivity at a teaching university would be viewed as evidence that the candidate would be even more productive at a research university.  Unfortunately, in practice these effects are often underestimated or not taken into account at all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One possibility is that there's something wrong with your husband's application.  For example, maybe his research statement is not compelling, or one of his letter writers is insufficiently supportive, or maybe one of them does not know how to write an effective letter of recommendation.  (You'd think that should never happen, but some well-established mathematicians simply do not know how to write effective recommendation letters.  If his thesis advisor is one of them, and the other letter writers are less energetic since they assume the advisor will make a strong case, then it could be really bad for his job search.)  I'd guess that 5-10% of job applicants have something seriously wrong with their application that they seem totally unaware of.  This is a low fraction, so your husband probably isn't one of them, but if possible he should discuss all aspects of his application with a trusted mentor who has guided numerous students to the sort of job your husband would like.  Sadly, he may not have such a mentor, but it's good to keep an eye out for one.  For example, if he strikes up a conversation at a conference with a senior mathematician who seems approachable, it's worth asking for job search advice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;He thought a hiring committee would scoff at the lower output of papers done by someone in a teaching job vs. someone churning out problems in a research post-doc. He even wondered if not having &quot;XYZ Awesome Post-Doc&quot; on his CV would trump any research he did.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lower productivity because of other duties is a serious factor here.  The CV prestige issue is real but considerably less important: prestige might serve as a tie breaker but won't get anyone a job if their actual accomplishments aren't commensurate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Letters of recommendation will be by far the most important factor.  What your husband needs is really strong letters that address his circumstances, talk about how impressive his research is and why, and explicitly make the case that he belongs at a research university.  Letter writers generally recycle letters from year to year with some updates to incorporate recent papers.  If his letters are not updated to address the teaching/research university issue, then they will not help him.  In particular, if they don't say in strong terms that he ought to be at a research university, then they'll be viewed as damning him with faint praise.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is something he can discuss with each letter writer, along these lines: &quot;As you know, I've been working at University X for the last couple of years.  It's great to be in a tenure-track job, but I'd really like to work at a research university.  To move to one, I'll need letters of recommendation that address this issue and make a strong case that I should be at a research university.  Would you be comfortable writing such a letter for me?  Of course I'll understand if you can't write one, since I know I'm asking a lot, but I'd rather ask someone else than waste everyone's time with an application that doesn't have the support it needs.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is an awkward conversation, but it's much better to ask than to leave it to chance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Would he be able to get back into academia if he had to leave to do actuarial work/industry/something that helps pay the bills?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's possible he could get another teaching-oriented job, although it's by no means a sure thing.  It would help a lot if he could spin the other work as informing his teaching.  For example, he could teach actuarial mathematics or incorporate realistic industrial applications.  In that case the non-academic experience could be an advantage; otherwise applying from outside academia would put him at a moderate disadvantage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the chances of getting a research-oriented academic job from industry are low (assuming the industrial job is not at a prestigious research lab like Bell Labs).  There are people who have done it, but it's not likely or easy.  Few people can maintain a high-quality research program on the side with no support while holding a full-time job, and this is necessary for returning to a research university.  In particular, there's virtually no chance of returning based solely on having done research in the past, without having actively continued in the meantime.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The way it typically plays out is that you reluctantly go to industry intending to maintain your research and keep applying for academic jobs.  For the first year or two, you complete and write up work you began in academia, and it feels like everything is going well, but your job applications don't do any better than they had before: you've got a more substantial research track record, but your industrial position emphasizes your inability to get a job in the past.  Still, you figure that accumulating more papers will eventually tip the balance in your favor.  Unfortunately, the next few years don't go as well.  It's hard to find the time for research, you have few people to talk to or derive inspiration from, and progress is slow.  However, you're gradually getting somewhere, so you figure it will just take a little longer.  A few years after that, you start to lose your resolve to do research at all.  Even if your applications were successful, would you really want to take a 50% pay cut, give up your job security, and move to another city to restart your career?  And it's hard to keep your focus on an incredibly time-consuming hobby that seems like it may never lead anywhere professionally.  You quit applying to anything but dream jobs you're pretty sure you won't get, and eventually you give up on them as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The good news is that this path doesn't generally end in depression, but rather the discovery that there are plenty of fulfilling life paths outside of research universities.  It's by no means a bad outcome.  However, leaving academia for industry can be really stressful if you want to return to a research university, since you have to either give up or work like hell to maintain your research program.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

It is possible. Because I know this guy who had been in exactly the same situation except that he got his math Ph.D. a few years earlier than your husband, and got a job at a reputable research university. If he's somehow believing that a prestigious postdoc position is necessary, I know a person who ended up in a gratuitous position for a short while and then landed on a very prestigious postdoc job in math. In both cases, they had strong publication records and also convinced other researchers in the same fields that they are something.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, there must be way more math Ph.D.'s who wanted jobs at research universities but got stuck somewhere else than those who succeeded. So, it's true that, statistically speaking, chances are very slim, especially if he himself doesn't think he can make it. But there are things he's in control of, and he can make the probability fatter. Do good research, publish it, and show others what you're made of.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ah, I almost forgot. If he's looking for a job this year in combinatorics, information theory, coding theory or quantum information science, well, sorry, but he should wait another year. There is a talking duckling in California looking for that sort of job this year, and that duckling should get it. I know your kids are super cute, and they want their dad to be happy, too. But this duckling is even cuter. If your husband's field is different, then no problem. Kick his butt and tell him to apply to as many jobs as possible with his awesome publication list he's going to develop and strong recommendation letters he's going to get (unless his depression needs a professional help. In that case, that should be fixed first, I think). Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

So he basically can do research wherever and whenever he wants, meaning, he need not be in a specific place to do his research. In the mean time he can get employed in a place where he can earn money using his skills. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So while his research is done at home, he can work elsewhere till he feels that his research has matured enough to require a lot of attention. Once his work is publicized I'm sure there will be a lot of people to come forward and assist. Some of us developers use and believe in open technology as the future, hence we publish whatever we do for the benefit of the world.

Especially when he is doing it for personal reasons that I have no control over (e.g. gender, skin color, nationality, religion, sexual orientation, accent, etc). My chair hates me, so he harasses me with bad teaching loads, too many preps, assigning me one class at 8am on one campus and another class at 8pm on a separate campus three hours away, making me teach every day when others teach only twice a week, denying me funding to go to conferences, not permitting me to go on a sabbatical, etc etc etc. He is highly unethical. I suspect he discards good teaching ratings I get and pencils in bad teaching ratings but I have no way to prove it. He makes up untrue anonymous complaints from anonymous students and anonymous complaints from anonymous faculty / staff. When a particular person is not hired and everyone wanted to hire that person, he whispers to everyone that I am the one who voted against hiring. He tries to turn everyone against me. When anything even remotely goes wrong, he blames me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He has the Dean in his pocket. He is also the chair of the faculty senate, childhood friends with the university president, brother-in-law of the provost. He is not the research type - he has one of those Ed.D. degrees and is a career administrator who has been the department chair for 17 years now. When I was hired, he was on medical leave, so he had no say in my hiring decision. He is also the only person in the department who does not teach or do research related to the department. He is a politician - former mayor of a small city - so much more astute and politically shrewd than I can ever be. He is dishonest, a blatant cheat and a frequent liar, so sitting down with him definitely never helped. He has superb contacts within the town and in state politics. Short of finding a new job, is there anything I can do?

One key question is whether you have tenure: if not, you're presumably doomed (if the chair's behavior is as bad as you fear) and you will need to find another job anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Assuming you have reasonable job security, I'd sit down with the chair and ask what he envisions.  Don't complain, argue, or try to present your side.  Instead, you could start by acknowledging that the two of you have unfortunately gotten off to a rough start in your working relationship, and that because of his stature and leadership role it's important for you to earn his respect, so you'd like his advice on how to improve the situation.  Your goal is to learn, not to debate.  Don't explicitly agree to any facts that aren't true, but you don't have to fact check everything he says, and you shouldn't dispute his perspective or opinions in this conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One possibility is that he is an insecure jerk who wants you to submit to his power and authority.  If you do so, and let him boss you around a little without complaining, then he may treat you somewhat better.  [This is assuming he can't treat you any worse than he already is.  If you fear things could get worse, then be careful, but your question suggests you don't have a lot to lose.]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another possibility is that he just doesn't want you around, and there's simply nothing you can do to get on his good side.  In that case, maybe he could help you transfer to another related department, for example.  Of course, you can't even bring this up unless you have some job security, since otherwise you have no leverage at all.  And it's important to do it in a face-saving way.  There's no way it will happen if it looks like he is getting rid of a problem employee (the administration and the other department will not accept that as a valid reason for such a transfer), and obviously he won't cooperate if the stated reason is getting you out from the control of an irresponsible chair.  Instead, you'd have to give it a positive spin: helping your career by giving you a chance to develop in a slightly different research direction, building ties between departments and fostering interdisciplinary connections, etc.  It may be galling, but you need to set this up in a way that makes it look like your chair is doing something valuable for the university by helping to arrange it.  If you can get your chair enthusiastic about this, and if there's another plausible department, then the chair's influence within the university might really help you.  And don't be too restrictive in ruling out possible departments: there might not be any appropriate match, but I know of a couple of cases in which people have successfully resolved personality conflicts by moving to departments that were a bit further afield than one might expect (engineering vs. science, for example).  If you've got tenure, then the university has a powerful incentive to fix this conflict, even if it means letting you sit in an odd department.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Leaving the university is radically different from switching departments, and you should not ask the chair for help in doing that.  Within the university, your chair's standing with the administration will play a major role in what opportunities are available.  Outside the university, your chair probably can't help you very much, but could certainly hurt you, so it's not worth the risk.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The worst case scenario is that your chair hates you and wants to hurt your career, regardless of which department you are in.  In that case, there's nothing you can do if your chair has the full support of the administration, and you'll have to either leave the university or wait for the chair to retire.  However, you shouldn't give up all hope until you've exhausted options like submitting or transferring.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

Not a &quot;maybe&quot;, not a &quot;perhaps&quot;: that is just what it is. This assumption could be right or wrong, but any dean/chair/professor wants to have a supportive (adoring?) team. So either you adapt to the system, or you will make your life very miserable: make your contributions very clear, boast about your workload or find another place. Bullies like strong (and loud) voices.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2) Do not confront the bullying person: it's anyway an unfair battle, since they're managers and higher-ranked anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;3) Be blatantly open with what you do, aka &quot;blow your own trumpet&quot;: when you start doing it, others reply as well, and you start realising that your &quot;case&quot; is no worse or better than somebody else's.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MISTAKES TO BE AVOIDED:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;I think that the worst mistake to be done in these cases is moaning about the issue, or using &quot;allies&quot; to make the case, or asking the unions to do something about it. Moaning won't solve your case, but just make your stomach more acid; internal allies will not either: having allies and support is generally a good thing, but I realised that I was just &quot;using&quot; them to reinforce my assumptions and beliefs (ending up in a infinite loop of self-commiseration); unions will just use a pre-defined strategy that will be well known in advance by the bully.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REMEDIES:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;Since you do not want to change your affiliation (but sadly this is the only real way to solve the issue, I am afraid), my take on the issue is to be honest with yourself, and ask whether your workload could be worse, or if you could make a request to avoid some teaching times by using some reasonable excuses, and in general stopping being negative about the person. The latter is tough but again, if you're being (overtly or secretly) negative, the bully will make your life even worse.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RESOURCES:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;An excellent blog on the matter, and an &quot;external&quot; voice to talk to (yes! they talk and listen to you, also privately...) but in the UK: &lt;a href=&quot;http://bulliedacademics.blogspot.co.uk/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://bulliedacademics.blogspot.co.uk/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

This is hugely beneficial because it exposes you to different sub-fields, but more importantly because it exposes you to different work dynamics and environments, allow you to cope better in your PhD; furthermore, you'll make more contacts (which is all that matters in research - reputation and recommendations) and learn from different people. It'll give you the confidence to know, during your PhD, whether you are right or wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The downside is that it takes you one more year and there is no guarantee you'll get a PhD after, and there is also the extra cost - most funding bodies do not fund a one year masters. However, if you apply for a 4-year Masters with PhD, funding options are more generous.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I can only speak for England, unsure about other countries, but the same principles apply.

As Peter suggests in his answer, a faculty can be a collection of &quot;departments.&quot; However, a faculty in Germany (for instance) consists of a number of &quot;chairs,&quot; each of which is closer to a professorship in a department than an actual &quot;department.&quot; Thus, the faculty is effectively halfway between the American &quot;department&quot; and &quot;faculty&quot; in its function, as it combines some of the hierarchy and responsibilities of each.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The reason for having multiple subdivisions is that there are often many university functions—including personnel and budget decisions, facilities management, teaching, and so on—that can vary widely across the entire university, but significantly less among certain departments that have a similar focus. For these departments, it makes sense to combine these duties in a central administration, rather than duplicate the effort across multiple departments. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

In many Universities in North America, computer science moved from &quot;science&quot; to &quot;engineering&quot; and my father perceived that computer science departments in &quot;engineering&quot; were more promising than those in &quot;science&quot; (as at the time engineers made more money and had more job opportunities than scientists).

I believe the first thing to do is to avoid to go by insinct and &quot;fight back&quot;. Obviously the correct response will rely on the type of communication/accusation but keeping a calm and cool tone is the best. Keep all replies very short and avoid emotional touches at all costs. &quot;Thank your for your opinion.&quot; (or something along those lines) is enough to have provided a response while practically ending the correspondence since there is nothing more to reply to. To try to &quot;kill&quot; the conversation by not providing fuel is the way to go. In verbal communications a simple &quot;OK&quot; can be enough. Then try to walk away at the first opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bad behaviour is otherwise best fought with good science and academic professionality and one must try to find moral support in situations like this so that ones self-confidence is not shattered. There are many destructive behaviours that affect us, some temporary some part of (or deficiency in) a personality.

But if I were you, I'd send a short and polite email to the journal to ask what is up with your paper, probably after waiting a bit more. If it doesn't work, I'd send another polite email to someone else working for the journal. In any case, you should understand that the editor is a volunteer (unless you're submitting to a journal with fulltime editors like Nature, Science, PRL etc.), and sometimes it takes a while to handle your submission for various legitimate reasons. So be polite when asking what's going on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Edit: And the best way to know if two months is too long is to ask experienced researchers in your field like your advisor if you're a student.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

If the improvement really was because of &quot;serendipitous success,&quot; it seems that it would be difficult to sustain, unless it happens that the groundbreaking work was so monumental that it is prize-worthy (and even then, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Louis_Pasteur&quot;&gt;chance favors only the prepared mind&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If I'm writing a positive letter (which is almost always the case--I'll try to convince a student that I'm not the correct person if I feel I won't be able to justify a strong letter), my goal is to convince the letter-reader that I'd hire/accept the person &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;, and why.  Something like the following might fit this case:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I have been particularly impressed by X's recent work on her project, &lt;em&gt;Nuclear Powered Time Travel via a Modified Consumer Vehicle&lt;/em&gt;.  Despite a frustrating set of circumstances that returned limited results in the early stages of the project, her hard work and persistence led to a breakthrough that she is currently preparing for submission to &lt;em&gt;The Twin Paradox Journal&lt;/em&gt;, and will undoubtedly lead to further successful results.  Specifically, she was finally able to properly shield the flux-capacitor plutonium containment compartment in her design, reducing temporal errors by 99% and leading to far greater box office returns.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the student's previous attitude, or struggles don't put her in a particularly good light, don't include them explicitly.  Again, it goes back to &lt;em&gt;would I hire or accept the student now?&lt;/em&gt;  If you believe that by not including the specifics you're not being honest, then maybe you wouldn't feel comfortable with such a positive letter anyway.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

I hope this is not the wrong place to ask. My question(s) are comprehensive and long, as the title suggests, thus I have numbered and sub-numbered the questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that these questions are targeted at schools that do not allow me to upload a CV otherwise I think half of these questions would go away.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Courses&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1a) Is it silly or a waste of space to talk about your math background? Or should I assume the graduate committee already has this? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1b) Some schools I have checked out actually asked me to list out all my junior/senior courses along with their books, I guess for those schools I don’t need to? What about those who do not?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1c) Should I write or mention courses I have self-studied? Or is this completely irrelevant to them? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1d) Should I also bother explaining one W and one ‘bad’ mark that happened in the summer?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1e) Should I mention my math department is understaffed and I tried to take as many “hard” classes as possible? How understaffed? We have only at most four math classes at the senior level every year. We are so small that most junior/senior classes stop only at the introductory level. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, we only have: introductory PDE, introductory Number Theory, introductory Algebra, and Topology does not even exist at my university. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Very rarely do we get continuations to those courses. In comparison with all the other areas, we have quite a lot of Analysis courses, but all of them are focused in Optimization (excluding Real Analysis, we usually have one to two Analysis classes).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We have no Calculus of Variation, no Measure Theory, almost nothing. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;FYI, I had to go out my way to bug a professor to request an extra Analysis course this year to the unit head and even then I am short on Math classes next year.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TA experience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2a) Should I talk about this? How will they even verify me? Because I have done some things that most TA don’t do at my university – writing exam solutions. The prof I TA’d for left everything for me to do, except the teaching and actually writing the midterms/finals. I never had a class with him, so I am not so sure about asking him to write a letter for me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2b) I also TA’d for another prof at another campus during one summer term(same university, but different Math department), should I mention this? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;I can provide a link of my exam solutions through the prof's site. I think he will give me permission, should I include this?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;3) &lt;strong&gt;Research Experience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have &lt;em&gt;very very&lt;/em&gt; little experience, so much that I could probably only write one or two short sentences about it. I also have no publication, but I think the prof I worked for can&lt;br&gt;&#xA;confirm that I did do research under him. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By the way, the “research experience” I had was a problem the prof had written by hand on a math paper and he asked me to answer the question he posed. It was not an analytic problem, it was coding, graphing, and writing a report. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;4) &lt;strong&gt;Area of Interest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;4a) I already know my area of interest, I am wondering if it is a good idea to write why I got interested in the first place or is this completely irrelevant to the graduate committee? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My reasons are rather absurd, I am going into my desired area because of a textbook writer and the textbook I read by him isn’t even the area I was interested in, although the writer did write a book in the subject and I was simply in love with his style of writing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I later found out the writer’s background and plus some neat stuff I read on the Internet sealed the deal for me. If people think this reason isn’t silly or “cliché” (e.g. “I liked puzzles when I was young”), then please tell me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;4b) Also one major problem is that I can’t talk too deeply about my area of interest. i can mention specific subfields, but that's about it. For instance, if I liked Number Theory, I could mention &quot;Analytic Number Theory&quot; and the &quot;Riemann Zeta&quot; or if I liked Differential Geometry/PDE, I could mention &quot;Geometric Analysis&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So would it be better to omit the details if I can't comment too much on the details of the subject and simply write &quot;Number Theory&quot;? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;5) &lt;strong&gt;Thesis Advisor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I can find people and mention their names easily on my personal statement. I am just curious if I should narrow it down to only ONE person? Does it look bad that I am just listing out the people whom I want to work with instead of writing down just one name?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;6) &lt;strong&gt;Scholarships/Award&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have never liked the word 'Award', so i am going to use 'Scholarship'. Do I need to mention about a scholarship I got from a professor? Again, how can I be verified for this? I think I could ask the prof who gave it to me (whom I did reasearch for) to mention/confirm this?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;7) &lt;strong&gt;Skills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How much will it add to my application if I tell them I can use LaTeX (honor's thesis not required for honors degree at my university. I asked one of my profs why and even he doesn't know.), high proficiency with Mathematica, Maple, Matlab, etc...? I was going to add Photoshop, but then I realize how pointless and irrelevant that is. I can also use Python, but since I am postponed my 1st year computer science requirements till my last year I do not think they will buy this. Also my school teaches Java.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thank you very much for reading and taking this time to read this ridiculously long question(s)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT CLARIFICATION:&lt;/strong&gt; I am applying to US/Canadian universities&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

<answer QuestionId="A comprehensive question about personal statement" AnswerId="cZKTJp+JsLRMO+fF1tzbUA==" Author="980" Date="2013-06-05T12:53:27.547" Score="5" Text="&lt;p&gt;Responding to questions approximately in order:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is not a waste of space to talk about your mathematics background. Mere course titles tell almost nothing, so it's good to explain more. Telling the &lt;em&gt;authors&lt;/em&gt; of the texts used explain a lot to experienced mathematicians.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Especially if your school has a relatively weak program, and even if not, telling what self-study you've done is very important. It is all the more important as an indicator that you take initiative, are driven by curiosity about mathematics, independent of grades and structured programs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Explaining briefly that you've had TA experience is a small plus, because almost all grad students in math are supported by TA work, so knowing in advance that you can communicate will ease the minds of admissions committee members.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Despite the contemporary pretense that undergrads &quot;do research&quot; between their junior and senior years, it is very rare that any sort of genuine research occurs. Sometimes, but rarely. After all, if research only takes 8-10 weeks in the summer, with almost no prior background, why does a PhD takes years? :)  (There &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a good purpose served by the summer programs, though, of giving undergrads the idea that mathematics is not confined to a classroom and textbooks, as well as creating social connections with other undergrads seriously interested in math. But these situations don't really produce cutting-edge research.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;About &quot;specific interests&quot;: of course it is vastly better to have tentative, ill-formed, and inevitably ill-informed, &quot;interests&quot;, rather than &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;. :)  I'd encourage you to tell how these interests arose, giving the admissions committee some insight into your approach to mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's good to mention scholarships. People will not be so skeptical that you need to document it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Computing skills are a positive, and deserve a brief mention. Again, there is little need to offer &quot;proof&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In summary, it is a mistake to think that one's transcript explains what the admissions committee wants to hear or needs to know to make a reasonable decision. An informative personal statement makes a huge difference, especially in communicating your motivations and learning outside classrooms. Also, letters of recommendation from mathematicians well-acquainted with you, from contexts of relatively advanced mathematics (rather than elementary) are very important to give an idea of how well you'd fare with more advanced/sophisticated work. (After all, many people do well-enough in undergrad material, but find that graduate-level mathematics has a slightly different nature... of less interest...)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

Graduate schools may be wanting to be sure you covered what they consider necessary as undergraduate mathematics. Upon being asked I'd consider sending along a short syllabus of the courses you took. I'm almost sure your university must have these things.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(1d)-(1e) Don't even mess with this unless specifically asked, which I think it's unlikely to happen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The lack of any topology/measure theory (and perhaps more) courses in your university (or college...?) is a rather serious one, imo, and it may point, again, at some lack of elementary basis most mathematics depts. are supposed to have.&#xA;in fact, I think it is likely some universities could require from you to complete several courses before they considere you as an actual candidate for graduate school in mathematics...are you sure that what you studied in that school of yours was &quot;mathematics&quot;? Perhaps it was something like &quot;applied mathematics&quot;?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't think serious graduate schools require TA from undergraduates. In fact, mentioning you TA'd some course before being a graduate could be considered as (another) sign of a low mathematics level in your school.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To require research? From an undergraduate? I don't think there's such a university. What could be required, imo, is good skills to &quot;hunt&quot; for books, papers, etc. in a mathematics library and, in our days, perhaps also in the web.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No need to dwell a lot with your area of interest. Perhaps mentioning some of the wide areas (analysis, topology, algebra) could be enough, though imo most decent graduate schools require from graduate students to take two or more rather hefty, year-long course in some of these areas, and only &lt;em&gt;later&lt;/em&gt; you begin to drift towards your love...&#xA;The same applies, imo, for thesis advisor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please do mention any scholarship-award you got that's connected to your studies. This may be rather important.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;About skills: I don't think anybody will really care about it. Most probably schools will be more interested in finding out about your seriousness, love for the subject, responsibility, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

For example, in my university when you are graduate student you can *not* be a TA, but rather some that helps with grading exercises, exams and substitutes instructors and, very rarely, lecturers when needed. Only when one is a master student (PhD candidate) one can then be a TA and freely substitute lecturers and, even sometimes, be a lecturer. All this with scholarships, grants and stuff. This is why./>

In principle you could certainly put in too much, but in practice I don't think I've ever seen a mathematics paper I thought actually did have too much.  If you structure your writing so experts can easily skim things they already know, then I don't see why extra explanation should trouble anyone.  Tradition requires being concise, but that tradition was based on the economics of publishing.  Space in printed journals used to be a scarce resource, and if you spent it on unnecessary exposition you were keeping someone else from publishing at all.  Publishing still isn't free (and readers have only so much patience, as well), so you shouldn't include enormous amounts of unnecessary background, but traditional writing styles should be adjusted to account for the greater availability of space.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's possible that a referee or editor will object that they don't like your style.  You may be able to resist making any changes (it depends on how exciting your paper is and how high your own status is within the community), and if you do make changes you can still keep a lot of explanation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If necessary, it's worth having two versions as Paul Garrett suggests.  If you do, then you should make it very clear which is which and what the differences are, to avoid serious confusion if someone refers to the paper without realizing they need to specify which version.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The background material is &quot;standard&quot; in the sense that anyone who works on this class of problems would know the definitions or results in some form. However, this is at most a few hundred people, while if I include the background material my paper should be comprehensible to an advanced undergraduate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One reason to be generous with explanation is that it's easy to overestimate how much people know.  Aiming at advanced undergrads is a good way to make sure grad students really can read the paper.  If you aim at experts, you may write a paper only your own collaborators can comfortably read.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Some of the background results are part of the folklore of the field, and I've never been able to find a proof of them in literature. While they are believable and not hard to prove, I feel someone should bother doing it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a great reason to include a proof, although it's important to consult with experts to confirm that there really isn't an accessible proof in the literature.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;It makes the paper longer, although even with the background the paper is not long (13 pages).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You should make sure it doesn't look like padding, say with just a few pages of original content among the 13 pages.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;From what I've heard, it is generally considered bad practice to restate definitions and constructions states elsewhere and to reprove theorems available in literature.

You might not strictly need any more, but I'd recommend tracking down additional references for background.  As a general rule it's best to cite generously, giving plenty of credit to other authors and offering many resources to readers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Regarding giving the impression that you haven't read the literature, it's important to be clear about what's background from the literature (with a citation), what's folklore, and what's your own contribution.

Note that it is possible to suggest names for review but also provide names which are not preferred. The latter can be because of a scientific disagreement, personal issues or whatever. Such suggestions appear but not often and we usually follow the suggestions (not that we have to!). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the preferred or suggested reviewers, I have been tempted to use such reviewers on occasion when it has been hard to identify reviewers directly. Sometimes because the topic is local and where it would make sense to have local input. In these cases, I cannot remember a single reasonable review that has come out of such reviewers. This can be for several reasons but most often the review is a close colleague who might have an incentive to help the author. In some cases the preferred names have been very senior scientists who, I am afraid, has lost touch with the subject and provide poor and in some cases almost non-existent reviews. Out of all immediate &quot;Accept&quot; review recommendations I get, the vast majority have come from these reviewers. So, I not longer trust these names and avoid them at all costs unless I personally know or know of the reviewer and his or her good reputation. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In addition to what I just describe, I also must state that it is often the weakest manuscripts that have listed several suggestions. This can be identified by the disparate review results, sometimes one accept (by the suggested reviewer) and one reject. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, in principle, there is nothing wrong with suggesting reviewers, I have done so myself when being requested. I have then as a principle gone for established and well renowned names in the community. The problem lies in suggesting names for a purpose other than to get a fair and objective review.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is clear that the system can and is abused and since I became Editor-in-Chief, I have come to rely less and less on these suggestions and now mostly look upon them with suspicion and make selections from my own understanding of the field and investigations into the subject literature. The best suggestion, I can provide is to not avoid mentioning names but pick names that in your opinion can provide good constructive critique on your work (and not just favorable).  A note on why you have selected names as preferred or non-preferred would greatly help as well since it puts your choice in a perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

While on average reviewers selected by the author give fair, high quality reviews, that doesn't mean that the unscrupulous can't exploit this opportunity to select reviewers that share opinions that are far from the scientific mainstream in order to get dubious arguments into the peer-reviewed literature.  This is especially the case where the paper is on a contentious topic that is only tangentially relevant to the journal, so the action editor may not be able to easily find adequate reviewers from within their own field.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As an example, their are numerous papers published on climate related issues in energy, astronomy or general physics journals, which can easily be shown to be fundamentally flawed.  Where the journal asks for the author to recommend reviewers, it does raise the question of how much this contributed to the evident failure of the review process.  It seems to me to be better to avoid the problem ever arising.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately if the action editors cannot identify satisfactory reviewers by themselves, the work probably doesn't belong in the journal in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Being able to specify people who &lt;em&gt;shouldn't&lt;/em&gt; be used as reviewers is, of course, another matter entirely.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To answer the question directly, suggests the names of reviewers that you consider to have the required expertise in your field and who can give you a rigorous, but constructive review.  Don't choose people you know personally if there is someone equally well qualified that you don't know.  I recall reading that when you receive reviews you are getting advice for free from experts who's time you couldn't afford to buy, so why not attempt to get the most value from it as you possibly can?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

The overall conclusion seems to be that reviewers suggested by authors provide reviews of equal quality than those selected by the editor. While they are more likely to suggest acceptance in the initial review, at later stages these suggestions seem to equalize. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As an author, you should have a high interest in getting over that initial review, and if you do it well, suggesting reviewers is a very good opportunity for that. I'd always suggest to make use of such an opportunity, since you probably can judge best which potential reviewers &lt;strong&gt;will look favorably&lt;/strong&gt; at your paper. And that's of course what you want.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you know an expert personally, that's usually a good option. It has to be handled with care though. When you're too close to a suggested reviewer, the editor will give significantly less weight to the recommendation of that reviewer if he knows about personal ties. But if you go to conferences and talk to people about your research, you could suggest them as reviewers afterwards if they have similar interests. Or look at your reference list, as suggested in the answer by Anthony Labarre.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

It is of course still possible to end up with a similar or even identical sentence by accident, particularly if you describe a method or something similar. If you end up using the same method for several papers it is also possible to simply reference your original description in subsequent papers.

But, I would not blindly just look at percentages of overlap but focus on where the overlaps occur. If it is in the methods section describing a series of steps ina  process it is clearly not as critical as if it is in the discussion or conclusions. If you find overlap and you can identify what it is, then go to my first suggestion and critically review if you need to say it again.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

It is described in details on a web site and available in a series of templates. Although I get a sense of tiredness when I read the material surrounding the &quot;identity&quot; I can also see benefits, to recognize the university &quot;products&quot; (sorry) among other materials at a congress etc. But, the question was about reproducing material. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I see it I would want to have the logo on material such as posters or presentations so that people can identify my affiliation. I am free to post presentations and posters or other materials on my university site with the logos on them. If I want to put some material out that is mine I simply would not use a unversity logo. An example: I have written several hopefully useful booklets on scientific writing to be used by students. This material is my initiative and is not the result of the university asking for it. These booklets are distributed for free using our web-page and I would gladly distribute them more widely if there was demand. So from this perspective I can see two different &quot;products&quot; where one benefits from the logo and one where I do not want it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now the rules of my university says the logo is copyrighted which means others cannot use it. this still means I can post material with the logo in public places. The problem arises if someone takes my, say, presentation and uses it as their own. Then they break the copyright and make themselves guilty of a kind of fraud by associating themselves with an organisation to which they do not belong. I still have done nothing wrong, posting material is fine and even encouraged. The copyright also prevents people from the taking the university logo and adding it to their own &quot;product&quot; fo rexample showing it on their web-page or using it for commercial uses.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So now, the content. You seem to indicate that you will be prevented from displaying your work without the branding. I do not think this is correct. The laws on copyright and particulary intellectual ownership in my country is very clear. If you have created something it is yours. In a commercial company you may end up sign off this right by becoming employed so that the things your develop within that company belongs to them, not you. That is how research in pharmaceutical companies work, for example. My university system has made attempts to gain rights to lectures etc. but this has so far failed miserably due to the strong laws. You need to check these laws that apply to you since I do not know how they may vary internationally; I would expect them to look fairly similar.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You mention &quot;proprietary fonts&quot;. This means the university has selected fonts and bought them from a font foundry so that you can use and copy them for free within the university system. This does not mean other cannot use them, they must simply buy them first so providing copies to persons outside of your university would be illegal. Since fonts are not included in Office templates or in pedfs resulting from your templates there is nothing illegal about distributing such documents. If you were to take the fonts and produce a product that you were to sell for your won personal gain, you will, however, break the law.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The bottom line, then, is that you can put your  material in the creative commons as long as you avoid the logo (ater all who would want to use a figure with somebody elses logo in it?). I cannot see the university preventing you from doing this unless they explicitly ask you to waive your rights. Material with logo has its place when you want to make sure your afficilaition is clear. If you do not want that, then I believe you are free to post things in another style. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally awareness of the laws and regulations concerning intellectual rights are important and I strongly believe it is good to carefully look at whatever applies in each of our cases so that we can react if someone tries to infringe on such rights.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

<answer QuestionId="Is searching in article references considered a systematic way of literature search" AnswerId="p4xwmqUb3hNBcsLDEOZsOQ==" Author="4394" Date="2013-06-06T14:22:39.423" Score="4" Text="&lt;p&gt;Databases are not complete and published articles do not necessarily reference all pertinent literature so it seems unlikely that one would necessarily capture everything relevant by using just one method. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Databases are probably relatively complete when regarding more recent publications. I would not like to define &quot;recent&quot; however but I see it as mostly post-1990's. But my guess is that databases are centered around more widespread journals and more local journals may not be well-represented. This means that depending on the search area they may be more or less complete. Going back in time more and more will likely not be found in databases so if the topic has a vital history then database searches will cover the &quot;recent&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Reference lists may pick up more older material but that is of course dependent on the authors willingness to research literature. It is possible one might pick up more esoteric references this way but I fear the selection will be fairly random and not comprehensive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So to use both methods seem like the safest way forward to me. Depending on the subject matter, having deeper understanding for where and when things might have been published in the past may be vital in order to capture most relevant literature on the subject. To venture so far as to say everything will be found is difficult. Particularly during the cold war much was published in for example Russian journals that never reached the west. Many discoveries published in the west were therefore missing out on the eastern counterparts and may not even have been first. Much has thus been lost by lacking translation and that goes for many if not most languages. One must also remember that the publication scene as we see it today was not utilized earlier, when internal reports and local journals may have taken up much research. To rely on just one of the two parts for methodology may therefore be inadequate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

These are definitely not going to be in databases, but may be cited in papers (thus the importance, at least in my view, of the second approach). It might be worth adding a third approach that involves search conference abstracts, where unpublished (especially recent) work is likely to be found.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

I found my advisors present a perspective paper along with many other renowned experts in the field, proposing and highlighting the approach I have been working on as the future direction in the field along with other important developments in a conference. Even though I was not a co-author in that paper, I did not consider it something wrong alluding myself that it was an advertisement to the work I was doing. I happened to attend the conference as a PhD student, and found that the presenter of the perspective paper (whom I don't know) presented more than half of his talk on my idea with my slides that I shared with my advisors. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;People really liked the idea and the approach and many are convinced that the idea is going to impact the field.

The deal is that neither B nor C would've been possible without A, and one of B or C was necessary to show the full impact and worth of A (think detailed theory paper A vs lab experiments B and C). For other reasons, it couldn't be written as a larger A+B or A+C paper, but that's besides the point. The problem here was that the advisor, being faster at churning out a paper, finished C before I finished B despite starting later and then he insisted that we focus on polishing and submitting C before returning to B (I was 2nd author). Indeed that's what happened and we cited C in B when B was also eventually published (thus changing the &quot;science order&quot; from how it was). Note: I was not actually worried about publishing C, just its appearance before B.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My issues were:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A was my idea, my work.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The idea for C was also mine (leading from A), but was shelved (by me) until I had the time to run the experiments for those (the assays and lab experiments weren't a small deal).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I'm the student needing advising, not poaching of ideas.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;publishing order of C before B looks like it was the advisor's bright idea, when it was not (no, really... this didn't start with the &quot;here, work on my old unfinished idea&quot;)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The advisor's view was:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A is already published, so it's &quot;out there&quot; for everyone including him.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;B and C are not exactly the same, so what's the big deal?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In the long run, precedence differences of O(weeks) won't matter, period.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I'm also an author and I now have 3 papers instead of 2.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the end, I came to terms with it and in hind sight (after 5 yrs), should not have made such a fuss because&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I got 3 papers instead of 2 &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It was a fresh change of roles (he did do the work, and I was in an advisory role)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In the long run, precedence differences of O(weeks) didn't matter (might be different in other fields), and since I continued publishing in the same field, it now looks like I'm the man behind the plan.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Resentment never did anyone any good.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The dude is a hell of a supportive advisor in all other ways, so this wasn't worth burning bridges. Maybe he genuinely didn't see things from my PoV and didn't intend to poach.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is – what you're describing, while borderline, might not be uncommon. Especially, using graduate students' results in a presentation to a funding agency, but passing it off as their &quot;project&quot; is very common, because despite what you might want to think, a lot of times, it's the reputation of the PI that brings in the money than the merit of the idea itself (i.e., a mediocre idea from a rock star PI has more chances of getting funded than a rock star idea from an unknown researcher). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, it was absolutely wrong of them to have not included your name or acknowledged your contribution (which has never happened with me). You might want to bring that up, but you should think if you really want to burn bridges for a &quot;small&quot; reason. I say &quot;small&quot; in quotes because while yes, from a strict ethical PoV, they might be in the wrong, you're justified in your anger and is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a small issue for you, in the long run, the objective function of life is a multivariable function. Don't just fixate on one and make a decision (that you might come to regret) based on a local minimum that you're stuck in now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

Professors often take ideas that their students develop and write grants and papers out of them, but in the end, the interest that they drum up ends up generating more opportunities for the student. At the same time I heavily advise you to speak with your advisor about it and rather than carry an accusatory tone, take one that emphasizes the importance that you be involved in any and all aspects of the project (including authorship and appropriate credit)./>

Since it does not look like a very clear and frank misbehavior, even if you are perfectly right it would be tremendously difficult to prove it beyond doubt. In case of doubt, you could end up being seen more as the trouble maker than as the one who came up with that great idea; the surrounding people to whom you could complain (department head, etc.) would hesitate &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; to go against tenured faculty when the misbehavior is not crystal clear, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, I would strongly advise you not to confront to wildly with your advisors. You can (and should, as advised by Shion) discuss with them the fact that you are uncomfortable with the way they presented things, with the use without permission of your slides, and so on; but &lt;strong&gt;always let them a way to discuss it calmly&lt;/strong&gt;. If they feel cornered, there will be little chance of the situation not degenerating into a conflict, and it would be very difficult for you to survive professionally a conflict with your advisors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You could cite their perspective paper in a way that friendly makes explicit that the idea is yours. Your aim should be to get decent credit for your idea, even at the cost of letting your advisors benefit from it: think about what you have to gain or loose first, rather than about what they have to unduly gain or what you can cost them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If everything goes smoothly, you can get into a good position to build on your idea, and be on track for your career. &#xA;Once you're a respected tenured faculty, you should remember this episode and be supportive of young researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

This is done through open and frank conversations with the candidate about their research and career goals, what &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; need, what &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; need, where they intend to go next, etc.  A postdoc is at a critical time in their career, and everyone should know that they need to produce papers out of their PhD and that they may leave early if the right lifetime opportunity comes along.  I try to negotiate in advance about what research I absolutely need them to complete, what further I'd like them to complete, and to discuss writing and research schedules such that they can meet both of our needs and wants, preferably through some synergy (e.g. of the possible outcomes of this project, which would best suit both of our goals?)  I then try to agree a schedule about what research will be done when, what is the earliest date they'll start looking for their next position, when will they or we start writing the next grant or fellowship bid etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These negotiations give me not only a sense of how much I can expect us to accomplish if I make this hire, but also how well we can work together and how similarly we understand our responsibilities as academics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally of course there is a luck element:  if there is more than one viable candidate, the one who seems likely to be the best fit wins.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

For this one, I just look at the research work he has done (I don't care about numbers/publications, only about the quality of the work) and make sure that he will be able to work alone (mmm, this means that I look for someone that should already be a faculty member somewhere, but which is not for various reasons).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But what is interesting you I guess is the second type. In any project the most important thing is to make sure that we will be able to complete it in time. If I hire a postdoc for that purpose and if the postdoc don't do the job, I will have to do it myself, I don't want this to happen. So, the only thing that interests me is the ability to complete the goals of the project. Publications? except if the goal of the project is to produce papers I don't care. Skills? this is what I am looking for, and more precisly I am looking for confirmed skills, not exposure (too risky).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

If you cite in the second it is not clear from where the information in the first originates. A similar problem occurs if you cite an entire paragraph by adding a reference at the end of a paragraph ass &quot;(Xxxx, 2013)&quot; (I am fully aware that this is the norm in some fields).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Citing the same reference in two sentences is clearly wrong. The solution as I see it is to write the sentences so that it is clear they belong together. There are several ways to do this. One way is to avoid the passive, parenthetical, reference and use the active reference where only the year is in parenthesis. As an example, you can start the first sentence by stating &quot;Xxx (2013) states ...&quot; and then in the second say &quot;They furthermore  ...&quot;. In this example we provide a bridge between the two sentences so that it is very clear it is the same reference that applies. Instead of &quot;They&quot; you can also use &quot;Xxxx&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are clearly numerous ways to bridge sentences so the form depends on what you need to say. As a result I would recommend putting the reference in the first sentence, not the second.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

I do not know if this kind of discipline is big where you live, but it is one of the biggest disciplines in a lot of universities in germany and austria. A study from the university of vienna has shown that graduands from business informatics earn the most in the industry and have the least problems to get jobs out of all graduands.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You would have to take roughly one semester worth of courses in algorithms, software development etc. extra, but that should neither be an intellectual problem, since you already know a lot about it, nor a practical problem, because you will get a more academic and thus systematic idea of what matters in computer science.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even if you got into a computer science master right away, well how would that help you? You seem to have many practical skills from CS, but you would likely end up doing it just for the degree, because the students who have a bachelors in CS will most likely be much better prepared for doing the necessary methods for a masters program in that field. If you want the pure CS, you are likely much better off just starting with a bachelor, maybe aside working if you are already really good at CS.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you care about how &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt; a master will be, well that can't be answered right away.

Here's what my profile looked like:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Domestic White Male&#xA;Unknown state school in the midwest&#xA;Majors: Mathematics and Philosophy&#xA;GPA: 3.93&#xA;GRE:&#xA;Q: 168 (97)&#xA;V: 167 (97)&#xA;W: 5.0 (92)&#xA;M: not taken&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Interests: Analysis, Medical Imaging/Modeling, Mathematical Physics&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Major Coursework:&#xA;Complex Analysis, Discrete Structures, Applied Math (survey course mostly in Fourier methods and PDEs), Mathematical Statistics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Recommendations:&#xA;One from a top applied mathematician who was very late in sending them out, one from a professor from the previous year who is well regarded but has not had much contact with me and one from a young professor who was fresh out of post doc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other:&#xA;I'm 30 years old. Some former work experience as a co-op student in engineering at a national lab, dean's list, normal stuff like that. I had only completed two semesters at my current school, though. About 6 years ago I was an engineering student at a different institution with poor grades and I did not finish my degree. Also mid to high level (lots of national, some international competition) as an athletic coach working with kids, teens and adults. Some international experience as an athlete as well. I also speak basic German.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here's how my profile has changed:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Current GPA: 3.94 (.01 difference! However, this does mean 6 more As and 1 more A- to counterbalance my poor record from the early-mid 2000s.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;GRE Subject Score: 660 (52)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Additional Coursework: Formal Logic, Real Analysis, Advanced Linear Algebra, Intro to Abstract Algebra. This summer I am doing a course in number theory and an independent study in Galois theory.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Recommendations: I am going to give the late professor a much longer lead time this time around. He has said that he wants to help me but is always extremely busy. I will also be asking (and almost certainly receiving) a rec from the professor I am doing my independent study with.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Interests in pure math have shifted away from analysis, more into algebra. In applied, medical applications (organ/system modeling and imaging more than bioinformatics) have taken the lead over mathematical physics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other changes: Medalist in school's math competition, math tutor in our honors college and privately. Taking a Spanish immersion course so I can list basic spanish on there as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'll be taking the GRE subject again in October and am using saylor.org and MIT's opencourseware to review older subjects. I graduate in August and will be working for a year. I'm thinking about applying to teach at a high school or community college for that time. I also plan on taking one or two graduate courses per semester.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I plan on applying all over the place (&gt;15 apps) compared to the 8 from last time. I would prefer to go to the west coast. Can anyone let me know if the mid level UCs (Irvine, Santa Barbara, Davis) are reasonable with what I've got now, especially since when I worked at that national lab I was technically a UC employee? Any other recommendations on schools or anything I can do over the next year to boost this?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One other thing: I have no REUs, but is a good independent study with a strong recommendation from it a decent substitute?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for taking the time to read my post.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

<answer QuestionId="Improving my PhD application for math programs" AnswerId="92Z5yoZbLsNLMspXTk0QIA==" Author="user7628" Date="2013-07-06T11:54:15.510" Score="6" Text="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Since this was too long to leave as a comment, I'll post it here in addition to an answer&lt;/strong&gt;: Regarding the GRE Subject test for math: admissions wise, the scores are &lt;em&gt;mandatory&lt;/em&gt; for pretty much every top 10 program in the nation (Princeton, Harvard, MIT, UChicago, Stanford, UC Berkeley, etc). Since most potential candidates admitted to these programs have a track record for some type of research-related activity, less emphasis is placed on the scores and more on their potential as research mathematicians (after all, that's what grad school is about: research). However, in less prestigious departments like Irvine, Santa, and Barbara, more emphasis is placed on the subject test relatively speaking to the top 10 programs because one of the likely reasons some students end up in &quot;lower&quot; departments is due of the lack of research experience. Thus, much emphasis (though not all, credible research-related letters of recommendation are probably more essential) is placed on the subject test. Of course I'm not implying that lower grad schools look more at test scores than publications. I'm saying that it's probably more &lt;em&gt;expected&lt;/em&gt; that the students will depend on their scores than their publications precisely for the aforementioned reasons. Right from the words of the UC Berkeley website &quot;&lt;em&gt;Experience has shown that the score on the Mathematics Subject GRE is a partial indicator of preparation for Berkeley's PhD program.&lt;/em&gt;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for a &quot;good&quot; GRE score, take a look at what top programs expect of their applicants, and shoot for that range (the higher the better, of course). Once again, in the words of the Berkeley site &quot;&lt;em&gt;A score below the 80th percentile suggests inadequate preparation and must be balanced by other evidence if a favorable admission decision is to be reached.&lt;/em&gt;&quot; So if I was you, I would shoot for the 80th percentile at minimum.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now onto your question&lt;/strong&gt;: First of all, +1 to aeismail's answer. I agree with that assessment: It seems to me that you're all over the place! The lack of coordination, I think, might turn off the admissions committee because A) it shows you're not very concentrated in one or two areas which might imply that you don't know what you're going to do and B) you're not very committed to a specific program. Unless your research is going to coincide with different areas, and the scattering departments are a reflection of departmental strengths in those areas, I think that'll be a red flag that you really just want in based on rankings. And if that was the case, you might rejected on the basis of &lt;em&gt;lack of coordination&lt;/em&gt;. It won't be on their consciousness of course: there'll be at least 14 other schools that may admit you, so why would they care? &lt;strong&gt;Here's my advice to you:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apply to less schools&lt;/strong&gt;: 8 - 10 seems like a very reasonable range for me. Even if you don't explicitly state it, imply that you're not just going to grad school based on prestige or naming. Over 15 schools is too much. Show that you're looking at &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;specific&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; programs, with &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;specific&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; goals in mind (i.e Applying to schools X, Y, Z because of their strong research areas in 1, 2, 3 and your interest in 2 and 3). 2 safeties, 2 matches, 2 reaches, and 2 &quot;dreams&quot; (you never know :-). They're paying you to do research, not the other way around. Why should schools invest their time in you if you end up switching fields?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for whether or not these are reasonable choices, that's pretty much subjective. It would depend on the field you're going into (I have no idea how strong these departments are in analysis/mathematical physics) and that's something you can google. You'd also do well to check the websites of each of these schools and look at the expectations for their applicants. Whatever bar they set, shoot for just higher than that. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;REUs are just one way of getting research experience so don't worry too much about it. Senior thesis projects that culminate in publications are another. Working closely with a professor is one other way. I think ultimately (aside from research publications) the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;most important&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; factor that goes into graduate admissions are your letters of recommendation. If it doesn't show on paper, a credible professor may assess your research potential since they know best what research is all about. Of course the tricky part here is getting letters of rec from the right person: If you're getting them, you're better off getting it from someone who coincides with your research interest. Since you're interested in analysis, it wouldn't make sense to get letters of rec. from a basket weaving instructor. Get it from your analysis professor (preferably, someone who knows you well and from upper undergrad/graduate-level course). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Final thoughts: If you want to improve your PhD application, try starting an independent project or ask to work with a professor. Research that results in journal publications is very rare even for exceptional undergraduates, so do not worry about that. It's helpful to be able to focus on one project for a whole year rather than jump from one to another every single month (the reason for that is obvious: it indicates perseverance and patience, which is very important for any potential PhD candidate). And refine your statement of purpose to show what you have learned from undertaking said project(s). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

If this is similar to the way that your personal statement read to the committee, it could help to explain some of the challenges you faced in applying to graduate schools.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For instance, after reading what you have written, I can't tell if you're looking to do algebra or bioinformatics—or if you're in an &quot;I'm happy with either&quot; situation. If it's the latter, this can make it harder for a committee to accept you: algebra readers might think they'll admit you, only to have you wander off into applied math, and vice versa. You may find it better to concentrate on one area—or, better yet, show how the different topics you're interested in are actually related to one another.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another potential issue is the quality of your letters of recommendation. Is there anyone who can help you to evaluate your letters for you? Some colleges have career offices or academic counselors who can comment on the suitability of your letters for different kinds of programs (academic, industrial, etc.), although they probably won't &quot;rank&quot; them for you. If you had a very late letter, it's a good question as to how helpful it would have been, even if  it was from a big name (or perhaps that should be &quot;in spite of&quot; it being from a big name).  By this, I mean that the letter would only have value if it actually discusses your talents and skills in a meaningful way. A &lt;em&gt;pro forma&lt;/em&gt; letter isn't all that helpful, particularly if you are from an &quot;unknown&quot; program. (This latter can also make your job tougher, since your school might not have  a track record at many graduate schools).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, it also sounds like you have a rather untraditional academic history. This needs to be explained &lt;em&gt;clearly&lt;/em&gt; somewhere on your application, in a way that shows thattaking you into a graduate program now would not be a risk. (Not doing this could again feed into the notion that you're flittering around from one thing to the next—which is not a good impression for an admissions committee to have of you.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

On the other hand, if you are writing the first draft before having a crystal clear idea how your argumentation will flow (i.e. if, for you, writing is also a tool for &lt;em&gt;thinking&lt;/em&gt;), then writing in English might take take away from this process because it's difficult. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would certainly agree with everyone else that using English for the first draft is a good idea. But when I write, I also write an outline of the draft in a separate document. This outline summarizes each paragraph I plan to write, usually in a single sentence, so that it gives me a good overview of the structure the manuscript is going to have. I use it to combine the points I want to make with other findings I think are important to mention (usually I find that these don't match up very well on the first try!), and then I shuffle things around, add and remove items, until I have a story that will flow naturally from the questions I ask to the conclusions I make. And only then do I start writing the draft. And this outline, I would recommend writing in your native tongue. It should be easier to switch to English afterwards, when you begin writing the draft, because you'll already have a clear idea of what you want to say.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

There are real advantages to doing it in person, and most of the schools offering online degrees are not well respected, so if you select a program based on internet advertising, you will probably waste your money without learning very much or ending up with a valuable credential.  (It's depressing how many businesspeople view distance education as just a money making opportunity, without any serious commitment to doing a good job.  When you investigate online education, please keep in mind that many web sites are trying to sell you something of questionable value.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One respectable example is the University of Washington, which offers an online M.S. in applied mathematics, and there are some others like this.  They could be viable options if attending in person is impossible.  I do not know of any well respected math graduate program from a 100% distance education university in the US, so you should be very suspicious of such programs, although perhaps they exist in other countries (Open University?).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is no worthwhile online Ph.D. program in mathematics.  If your only goal is to get the degree itself, for example to move up in a salary scale for a job you already have, then it might be possible, but you would have to look carefully to make sure the program is accredited, and even so it won't be an impressive addition to your CV.  If you are hoping for a career in academia or industrial research, don't even think about an online Ph.D.  If an institution offers an online Ph.D. in mathematics, and presents it as being just as good and respected as a traditional Ph.D., then you should be extremely suspicious of the entire institution.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for computer science, I don't know as much about online master's programs, but the issues are similar and I imagine the conclusions are as well.

I went to grad school because math in undergrad felt relevant, and I loved the feeling of leaping from logical lily-pad to logical lily-pad en route to proving something. In grad school, though, these feelings have become fewer and far between. I feel like things have become more mechanical and more like banging my head against a wall. For the most part, I find it very difficult to motivate myself to do my work; I never look forward to getting started in the morning. I have finished required courses and qualifying exams, but the difficulty continues as I do a reading course in preparation for work with an advisor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Overall, I have realized that research math is not for me. I have quite enjoyed my teaching experiences, which so far consist of leading recitation sessions, tutoring, and the first week of teaching a summer course. Because of the heavy emphasis on &quot;teaching to the test&quot; in secondary education, among other things, I suspect I would enjoy teaching at, say, a liberal arts college more than teaching at a secondary school. However, I feel pretty inexperienced in teaching, and so I don't feel certain by any means about these feelings. This is now the only reason I would want to stay in graduate school. Is this enough reason to continue for the next 3-4 years to the PhD?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;According to my advisor, I would be in graduate school another 3-3.5 years for the PhD. I would love to work at a liberal arts institution in the US, but ideally one where the research load is minimal/nonexistent. The impression I got from skimming MathJobs recently was that such positions were relatively rare compared to research-intensive positions. Do you feel like I would be very likely to find such a job if I stayed for the PhD?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Any advice is much appreciated! Thank you, everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

In fact, the requirements of completing a PhD at most &quot;good&quot; places are a bit more strenuous than the &quot;research&quot; required at little colleges. In particular, as I gather from substantial anecdotal evidence, it is possible to be much saner/human in &quot;small&quot; situations, about pretension-to-research. True, it may not be wise to be &quot;too honest&quot;, as in many professional/human situations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That is, you might try to view &quot;the PhD&quot; as simply a college teaching license. Certainly if you do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; have it you'll be at an extreme disadvantage forever... One might view it as a prolonged licensure ordeal?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And, at the same time, it is quite excellent that you have realized so clearly that you don't want to &quot;be a researcher&quot;. This is much better than the self-conflicted delusional versions of the story. But what remains is to gain the credentials. &quot;Cred&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is not necessarily a recommendation to stay in your PhD program, especially since your recoil has been fairly strong (though one doesn't know how to interpret printed words' intensity...)

Not that being PhD'd makes anyone a better person! But, it adds something to the ol' resume, undeniably.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And, again-at-the-end, being &quot;too honest&quot; about one's disinclinations is not necessarily a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Good luck, ... in figuring out complicated things.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

Lecturers only teach; they don't do any research, and it is not necessary to get a PhD to be a lecturer (though I'm sure it doesn't hurt, and some positions do request a PhD). It seems that these positions are becoming more common, especially because the current Canadian government likes to cut costs, so funding is harder to come by. I would suggest searching for these types of positions, and hopefully that will give you an idea of what is out there, how many positions are available, and how many require PhDs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.psychology.uwaterloo.ca/positions/lecturer.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;one example&lt;/a&gt; at my university that does require a PhD (in Psychology, not math, sorry).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Having said all that, I don't think it's worth continuing your PhD if you're not enjoying it. If you don't like what you're doing, it's going to be very difficult to put the time and energy into completing your thesis. If the area of research is a problem (you're not interested in your research project, or you simply feel stuck), perhaps you can ask your supervisor for a different project, or switch supervisors, or even switch to another department, program, or university.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

There is also increasing interest in getting undergraduates involved in research, which means the faculty have to have research programs to get them involved in.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, there is a wide spectrum of expectations.  At the most selective liberal arts colleges, research expectations can approach those of a mid-level research university, demanding a regular output of papers published in good journals.  Elsewhere there can be more flexibility, replacing a specific requirement for &quot;research&quot; with the broader term &quot;scholarship&quot;; they might require only occasional publications, and they could be projects with students, or articles about teaching.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But in general, if you want an academic job in mathematics that doesn't require you to do any research at all, you're going to restrict yourself to the least selective tiers of liberal arts colleges, or to non-tenure-track positions (and often liberal arts colleges tend to have relatively few such positions, compared to large universities).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You might have a look at &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathjobs.org&quot;&gt;MathJobs&lt;/a&gt; to get a sense of what jobs are out there, and what they expect.

I've tried to be general, so it could apply to other fields, but if you're not in science at all it might not work for you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first step to writing a literature review is defining your topic. What is the key question/ concept you are trying to explain or summarize? This can be difficult if you are really starting from zero on a topic, and will probably need to be refined as you work on your review. But it's important to define this at least in draft form before you start.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second step is coming up with search terms. Begin by searching your question/ concept on Google Scholar or another large database - if it's a biomedical topic, Cochrane Reviews is a good place to start. I'm not sure if there are similar review databases for other fields. Look for a few key papers in the area, read those, and look at their reference lists. Also, record their 'key terms' (usually below the abstract) - these will help you define search terms. Pull relevant papers from their reference lists and repeat. Once you've gone through ~ 10 papers you will probably have a good sense of the type of key words that are important for your topic. Use these terms to build an improved literature search.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Third, you need to actually do the literature search. Your field probably has a database of journals - use this and your search terms to identify all relevant papers over whatever time frame you are interested. You'll probably need to refine as you go, so you don't get swamped with papers. I prefer to go use a systematic search strategy, even if I'm not doing a systematic review, since this removes some subjectivity. This means going through all results, and reading any papers which have titles or abstracts that suggest they may be relevant to your question. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fourth, you need to read and take notes. Make sure your notes are indexed by paper, so that you always have the citation of the original paper with whatever facts you note down. I find OneNote is a great way to do this, but there are other tools I'm sure. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For me, once I've read 20 or so papers, I usually have a pretty good idea of what the answer to my question/topic is, and what the nuances are. Then it's just a matter of organizing the notes that I've already taken into a rough outline of what I want to say (remembering to keep label all the facts/opinions with their citations). After that, you're ready to start writing, and it's not too difficult since you've already got a good sense of what to write as well as a rough draft in the form of notes. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One important caveat is that you should always re-write all your notes in your own words as you go through the outline converting it into a paper. This way, if you occasionally just copied the original author's text when taking notes, you won't end up with their words in your paper (which would be plagiarizing). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

Thus, your review should be your own argument largely in your own words, with others' work cited and sparingly quoted where it helps you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

It is unlikely that the chair will be excited to give a raise to the person who is going to leave, anyway. On top of that, as Daniel Shub put it, negotiating a salary increase means going at least one level up to ask for the extra money for the chair, and there should be a very good reason for this. Even if you just got the NSF Career award, the chair will just say, &quot;Great, you know have the research money to support yourself -- congratulations! No salary increase, though&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most likely, if you are going to complain about your pay being too low, you will hear a story about salary inversion, i.e., the tenured faculty in your department making less than you do, which is only justified a small fraction of the time for the deadwood faculty. So the priority will be to raise the non-deadwood inverted salaries -- they are here to say -- and then address your concerns -- you are not here to stay yet, sorry -- subject to any remaining money. Having heard you complaining is not likely to make the chair want you to stay, either.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In a very rare event, you can come up with a scheme in which you bring the department more money, and then your request to see an extra cut of the pie may be legit. This could mean creating a new program/degree/track that is going to be the nations first program in interdisciplinary bubble sort or bean scouting or some other BS, but then it means that you are committing to a teaching track rather than a research track. If your research is stellar, and you want to diversify into teaching, that's probably OK; but most of the time proposals like that from a junior faculty will look weird and awkward.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As JeffE said, you MUST talk to your chair once in a while, and the annual review time is one of the best opportunities to do so. Your case was reviewed by the faculty not so long ago, so the memories of your file are reasonably fresh in the chair's head; it would be easier for them to connect the dots than it would be say in September when the new semester starts, with new students and new courses and all other hectic stuff happening in the department.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

Asking for some extra research/travel money is &quot;cheap&quot;, especially if it is at the end of the fiscal year and there is extra money in the budget, since the chair likely controls that pot of money. Teaching load is often controlled by the chair, but does require someone else to pick up the slack so do cost some &quot;chips&quot;.

It's a formal exam which requires submitting a thesis and defending it in a colloquium much like the PhD, but (supposedly) on a higher level. Usually it also includes a teaching-related element. The habilitation used to be a requirement for being appointed as a professor, but in recent times also other criteria, which represent a comparable achievement to a habilitation, are being used. In Germany, having passed the habilitation allows you to use the title &quot;Privatdozent&quot; (even before being appointed as professor), with the same teaching entitlements as an ordinary professor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, also other personnel may teach at the university. Even fresh graduates from one study program may find themselves in front of a class of students who could be just a year or two behind them. However, that will always be under the supervision of a professor, or on the formal commission of the department dean.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In addition, there are recent efforts to offer a more formal teaching education for university staff, including certificates for those who take part in the programs. I'm mostly familiar with the situation in Germany, for example &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bzhl.tu-berlin.de/en/news/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hdz-bawue.de/das-hdz.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; (in German), but I imagine similar efforts exist in neighboring countries. At the moment, these certificates are however &lt;strong&gt;not a requirement&lt;/strong&gt; for university teaching, and I even doubt that they will become so in the near future.

If only people giving mathematical or dietary advice without credentials could be sued for failing to make a similar disclaimer! :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are two parts to this issue. First, is it ok to tell people students' grades? In the U.S., almost entirely &quot;no&quot;, if the student is 18 or older. FERPA. It doesn't matter whether or not the student's parents are paying the tuition, the student's grades are privileged personal information.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; acceptable use to disclose student grades for (e.g.) intra-math-departmental function, such as advising, admission committee work, and other &quot;privileged&quot; use.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A traditional practice that is no longer ok is posting grades on instructors' doors, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For &quot;old&quot; people, the idea that one is not in fact legally entitled to know the grades of the student whose tuition you're paying will seem strange. Indeed, decades ago, the grades were sent to the parents directly, in paper mail.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But, now, 18-or-over people are essentially legal adults in the U.S., and their school records (and medical records) are not automatically open to their parents.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thus, despite intuition to the contrary, simply do not give grades to parents, ... without seeking legal advice about extenuating circumstances, such as emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Edit: but, then, &quot;jail time&quot;? Who knows? But maybe monetary damages if someone sues you for violation of their privacy rights. Apart from the risk of this, if we think it through, maybe kids' grades (if they're &quot;adults&quot;) should not be divulged to anyone... So don't do it?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

This &quot;act&quot; is not a law (on further reading it is a law), but rather a stipulation by the Department of Education that universities must obey in order to receive funding. As such, I do not believe that violations are classed as a criminal offense and hence cannot lead to jail time. Universities which violate the FERPA can lose their funding and likely have grounds to dismiss employees who violate the act. The university might even be able to seek damages against those individuals, but again, not jail time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would suggest that you not violate FERPA. If you intend to, or have done so (accidentally or otherwise), I suggest that you seek legal advice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

You will have to devote yourself to the new job if you accept the offer. You probably have to work 50+ hours a week in the first year. It's very hard to do both at the same time if not impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You need to ask yourself a question. What was your reason to study for PhD in the first place? Were you interested in research? Or you wanted to have a PhD in order to have a better industry job?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If your ultimate goal was to have a good industry job, then you just got one. Grab it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you wanted to do research, being a retiree from industry, I can tell you that you are not going to have much freedom to do the research you want to do. You'll have to do whatever your employer wants you to do. You'll become a money maker.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, we are back to the basic question. What was your career plan? If you did not know the answer when you started the PhD program, now is the time to make that decision. If you still don't know the answer after pondering over for a while, then you need to think about Lev Reyzin's suggestion, that is, take leave of absence from Academia. This is not a true good idea, just a temporary solution. It delays your decision. Your attitude will be like going there to test water. Chances are, you'll not devote yourself to your new job. I am not too sure you'll succeed the industry job that way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My suggestion for you, figure out where you want to be 10 years from now. If the answer is Academia, continue your PhD. If it's industry, take the offer. You don’t need to have PhD to be a successful business person after all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

In more theoretical fields, your PhD can greatly outweigh the experience you can get.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Do you think that money will ever be an issue (since doing the PhD probably doesn't pay), and unfortunately you have to think of this as well.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you don't do the PhD now - how likely are you to resume it in let's say 5 years.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;How well is the university rated in your country ?

If the answer is &quot;yes&quot; and the current job is perfect, my advice will usually be to go. If you goal is to go into academia and to become a professor, the job is a distraction and you should pass on it and finish the PhD.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, things vary by field but my general advice, which I believe is true in most (but not all) fields, is that you need a PhD if you want to be a professor but that it is not critical for doing most other jobs. And because PhDs take up time that you could be sending getting work experience and promotions, it may even be harmful for these other pursuits.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Potential students make the wrong comparison when they judge whether or not a PhD is helpful to their career goals. It is common for people to compare themselves without a PhD &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt; to themselves with a PhD &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;. Obviously, the PhD will provide a leg up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But that's not the accurate comparison because there are opportunity costs to doing a doctorate. The true comparison is between (a) yourself with 4-6 years of experience in industry and no PhD and (b) you with 4-6 years work in a PhD program, no industry experience, and a PhD. In &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; fields, (a) is better, or at least not usually worse, than (b).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Doing a PhD includes a lot of effort that goes into navigating and succeeding in an academic environment. If you are going to be a professor, this is important training. If you are not, you are likely better off doing the things you want to end up doing somewhere more appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

If I understand you correctly, you'll be able to get a MPhil?  that will help with the first point (credits towards a PhD) and certainly is recognition of the study you have done so far.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So a couple of key questions you have to ask yourself are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which of the job or the PhD will lead you to your goals quicker and in a more enriching way?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How much would working at this company mean to you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;and related to the question above, will that opportunity resurface upon completion of your PhD?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another option, once again depending on the policies of your university is to defer the final year of your PhD or complete it part time, while you work (which is what I am doing).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;- &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;">

Copyright does not protect ideas, just how they are expressed, so writing your own version is not copyright infringement.  Academic norms require citation, but it is certainly OK to write expository papers on other people's research.  Your thesis sounds like a valuable contribution that should be made available to the community, and arxiv.org would be a fine place to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if by &quot;rephrasing&quot; you mean starting with their text and editing it (rearranging a little, changing some wording, making additions, but keeping the underlying framework), then your paper would be considered a derivative work under copyright law.  I've never heard of anyone actually being sued for this in an academic context, but you might be asked to take down your paper, depending on how closely you followed the original papers.  You might also offend the authors if you copy too much from them, even if there's no legal trouble.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The basic question I'd ask is whether you had the other papers (or near-verbatim notes on them) open in front of you while you were writing yours.  If not, then you should be fine, because everything you wrote came from you.  If you wrote your paper while actively studying theirs, then there's more risk: the fact that you needed to constantly look at their writing suggests you hadn't fully internalized their work.  In that case, you should look through your paper and make sure you didn't accidentally paraphrase too closely.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

That way, you will have a searchable document for any words that you may be looking for in your notes. You can also use the &lt;code&gt;makeidx&lt;/code&gt; package to add an index to your text document, which lets you &quot;tag&quot; sections of your documents with various keywords. I also make sure to cite what I read, even if it is for my own purposes. This is especially useful when you are writing a paper, since most of your references will be ready in &lt;code&gt;bibtex&lt;/code&gt; format.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It took me a while to get used to, but I find it very nice to have a well organized research log.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since requested in the comments, given below is what the log looks like. I don't want it to become a full latex document, but it should be sufficient enough to give you an idea. Note the index markers, which are basically &quot;tags&quot; that don't show up in the text.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;\section{Paper #1 Name, Authors, Date, \cite{...}}&#xA;My summary of the motivation and findings of the paper, or whatever I find interesting/useful.&#xA;May be as short as a few sentences or as long as a page, depending on how relevant it is. &#xA;\index{an important word}&#xA;&#xA;\section{Paper #2 Name, Authors, Date, \cite{...}}&#xA;Same thing here.. \index{another important word or two}&#xA;&#xA;\section{Paper #3 Name, Authors, Date, \cite{...}}&#xA;and so on..&#xA;&#xA;\printindex&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then you can look up your page numbers in the index, which is included at the end of the document.

And it may be non-trivial to learn what this path is. Thus, in effect, the phrasing of a high authority is not only &quot;burned into one's retinas&quot;, but, also, seems the only correct thing to say.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, first, do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; try to &quot;say something else&quot;, just for the sake of avoiding &quot;quoting&quot;, because that seeming paraphrase may be wrong, or deficient, or ... &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But, at the same time, extended passages should not be quoted, unless put in quotation marks.

Of course you have to describe your published results in technical detail, but as part of a larger narrative, not as stand-alone pieces.  Focus on the big picture, not on the tiny technical details.  Remember that your audience is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; just other theoretical computer scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;If the answer to 1 is yes, should I highlight my specific contributions in multi-author papers - as opposed to &quot;we proved this and that...&quot; ?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NO.&lt;/strong&gt;  &quot;My coauthors and I proved...&quot; is fine.  The public dogma in theoretical computer science is that in every paper, each of the authors contributed 100% of the work, which is why they are listed alphabetically.  You &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; any paper that has your name on it.  Your narrative will naturally focus on the parts of the paper that you are the most proud of, which are usually the parts that you worked on the most.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, if you're writing papers with your advisor or other more senior coauthors, there is a natural tendency for people to wonder if your aren't really just riding their coattails.  This is why you need a larger narrative in your statement—to convince the reader that you understand your results at a deeper level than someone who merely &lt;em&gt;read&lt;/em&gt; the papers.  This is also why you have papers with different sets of coauthors—so that the common thread through your work stands out as &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; contribution.  In particular, you have at least one paper without your advisor.  Right?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;If the answer to 1 is yes, I must list the references here that I'm mentioning, which are also stated (in the full list of publications) in my CV, right?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The approach I always recommend is to treat your CV as your bibliography, and to include a footnote like &quot;Numbered references indicate papers listed in my CV.&quot;  Of course, this means that your research statement never cites anyone else's work, except in broad narrative strokes, but for a brief document intended to sell &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; research program, I think that's appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Assuming there's no page limit, what's an appropriate length for a research statement?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Aim for three pages.  Less than two is too short.  More than four is too long.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That may not seem like a lot of space, but that actually works in your favor.

Fortunately, my understanding is that this kind of sexism is &lt;em&gt;mostly&lt;/em&gt; a thing of the past.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, female colleagues have told me that more &quot;benign&quot;, but still harmful, sexism is still very prevalent in academia. In particular, I've heard that implicit assumptions that women are less capable, or more inclined to be teachers than researchers, are distressingly common. As a mathematician, the results are distressingly obvious: most math departments are overwhelmingly male.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What are some ways in which sexism is unknowingly perpetrated by well-meaning people, in academia in particular? And how can those of us who are well-meaning make sure to avoid doing so?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

A entirely positive (in the sense of only trying to come up with a meaningful psychological theory; an economics term here) &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20080130023006/http://www.president.harvard.edu/speeches/2005/nber.html&quot;&gt;speech by Larry Summers&lt;/a&gt;, then President of Harvard, at NBER conference that promoted gender equality, costed him his presidency... not because he was biased, but simply because the bloody journalists highlighting the event had no clue about math. His argument was very simple: if we look at IQ curves, we see that females have an average IQ about the same or higher than males, and about 20% lower standard deviation. Mother Nature plays conservatively with females while experimenting on males throwing their abilities around. Whichever of these experimental traits the females find attractive are worth retaining through natural selection. So if we look at IQ&gt;80 or IQ&gt;100, we see more females; but at top 5% of the IQ distribution (115 or 120-ish on IQ scale), the ratio is roughly 2 males : 1 female. University professors are likely to be even higher on the IQ scales, probably circa 140+, at which point the ratio may be 5:1 (although of course the quality of the normal approximation in the tails becomes VERY questionable). Other examples Summers gave were underrepresentation of Jews in farming and agriculture, and of whites in the National Basketball Association (which may have to do with biological differences in genetic makeup for height, as well as how the proteins are being processed and muscles are built, between races).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think that conditional on having received a Ph.D. (probability theory term here), there is little difference between males and females in ability to produce meaningful research. Success in academia is dictated by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19070437&quot;&gt;other personal traits&lt;/a&gt;. They are &lt;a href=&quot;http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=gender+and+personality+traits&quot;&gt;correlated with gender&lt;/a&gt;, although again conditioning on high IQ/having finished a Ph.D. may change that correlation structure a lot.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Economists argue for distinguishing between the equality of outcomes and equality of opportunities. Do Nordic countries show greater equality of income because they redistribute more, or because they provide better equality of opportunities? &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-4991.2008.00289.x/abstract&quot;&gt;Read here&lt;/a&gt;. Is stunning income inequality in Brazil the result of discrimination, differential &quot;circumstances&quot;, or what? &lt;a href=&quot;http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=497242&quot;&gt;Read here&lt;/a&gt;. Academia, as any other walk of life, should strive to create equality of opportunities; equality of outcomes may or may not follow, depending on whether the individual traits are correlated with whatever we are trying to equate (gender, hair color, height, language spoken at home, etc.). Forcing inequality of outcomes will aggravate those who have benign better abilities and make people of lesser abilities lose incentives to strive to do better.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If one claims that &quot;women are better teachers than researchers&quot;, just ask: &quot;Hm. That's an interesting observation. We are both scientists; can you give me some references to any peer-reviewed literature on this?&quot; (note that I gave mine above :) ). If they can't, that's a biased accusation you can go to your superiors (chair, dean, university president) with. Just like drivers found guilty driving under influence, and undergoing humiliating driving clinics, whoever makes such claims should be made to go the literature on the cross of psychology, sociology, gender studies and labor markets to dig into the issue -- who cares if they are good in math, if they have big mouth, they should learn to control it. Join your local committee on women in faculty, or whatever the name of that could be in your university to make sure you know the ways that the university can protect you against sexism, and make good use of what you learn there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

Presumably, chemical engineers and computer engineers have similar intelligence levels, and the entrance requirements were the same, so how do you explain the difference?

<answer QuestionId="How is sexism unknowingly perpetrated in academia" AnswerId="2h5HhFQ3qBQum39ewvCJTQ==" Author="6782" Date="2013-06-13T23:01:42.423" Score="38" Text="&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;And how can those of us who are well-meaning make sure to avoid doing so?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you see something, say something.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You're correct that blatant sexism is mostly gone.  I'm a female computer engineer, and I have never been told that I can't do the job because I'm female.  What remains is &quot;death by a thousand paper cuts&quot; sexism.  For example, I was recently at a conference, and the small group I was in was discussing one of the presentations.  An older professor in the group remarked that the presentation was particularly good because the presenter was beautiful and wearing tight clothes.  Nobody called him on it: after all, he was trying to give her a compliment, mentioning it would be rude, he's older and things were different then, and so on.  And it's hard to blame them, because if that were the only sexist comment I heard that day, it wouldn't be such a big deal.  But shortly after that, someone jokingly said I should marry my PhD supervisor.  Then someone said a new tool is so user friendly that &quot;even your mother could use it&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Each of these incidents on its own is fairly mild: most people probably don't even realize they're saying something exclusionary.  Unfortunately, if you're a woman, each one reminds you that you &lt;em&gt;don't belong&lt;/em&gt;, so the cumulative effect is very discouraging.  However, if you correct every person who says something mildly sexist, you get a reputation as a bra-burning feminazi.  As a result, most women keep quiet, or only point out the particularly insensitive comments.  It would make an enormous difference if &lt;em&gt;other men&lt;/em&gt; would call out the ones who make inappropriate comments.  You don't have to be dramatic or rude about it, but a quiet &quot;I don't think that's appropriate&quot; would take a lot of the burden off women.  And naturally, you can try to be more aware of the things &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; say to make sure you aren't accidentally discouraging women.  A lot of sexist ideas are so deeply ingrained that otherwise fair and open minded people will say them without a second thought (like the &quot;even your mother&quot; comment).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't want to downplay the other valuable things you can do, such as volunteering at math/science camps for girls, but if enough men followed this rule -- even part time -- 80% of the sexism I encounter would disappear. To modify Edmund Burke's quote a bit,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;All that is necessary for sexism to triumph is for good men to do nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;">

If one wants to understand why there are few female scientists and engineers and whether it is an issue, the first thing would be to listen to female scientists and engineers when they tell what discourage and distresses them. Just saying that they should see no harm is actively wanting not to see the problem./>

If we object every time someone says something bigotted (re women or otherwise) ... Well, if we all did it, maybe it would help - but in reality, I've had to accept that most people are a little bigotted on some level, and you need to let it go some (most?) of the time. Good answer, esp. re the need to speak up for others, when you're not the target./>

Some other policies can unintentionally end up sexist against men as a study of Daphne Patai's Heterophobia makes clear.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Male sports teams getting cut also comes as another way in which a policy has ended up &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/02/sports/02gender.html?_r=1&amp;amp;&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;sexist&lt;/a&gt; unknowingly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want to avoid sexism in academia and elsewhere you need to care about men in general just as much as you care about women in general.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The number of answers which only address sexism against women here, without also addressing sexism against men makes it very clear that you can NOT eliminate or reduce sexism by focusing exclusively on the needs or interests of just one sex.  In fact, that comes as a way to perpetuate sexism. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The key to avoiding sexism lies in fully understanding the plight of both sexes and acting accordingly.  At present it seems that most people have a very long way to go before they come close to understanding the plight of both sexes. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

You have to be constantly advancing and publishing your research, traveling to conferences and seminars, and generally impressing the community in your field.  Odds are you'll have to make at least one long-distance or international move, perhaps several.  Any delay or gap during this time could permanently derail your career.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Coincidentally, the years from age 22 to 36 are also the best time (biologically) for a woman to have children (assuming she wants to do so, and most do).  And bearing and raising a child can certainly put a major crimp in your ability to keep doing the things listed above.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's pretty clear that this system was designed for men: men with wives who didn't work and could take care of children full-time.  It's very hard on anyone who wants to be an involved parent, and doubly so for the woman: pregnancy, childbirth, breastfeeding, and so on can't very well be delegated or shared!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Universities do tend to have standard-to-generous maternity and family leave policies, which certainly help with this in the immediate term.  What's less clear is whether (possibly male or male-dominated) advisors, hiring committees, chairs, deans, and tenure committees are as understanding in the long run.  If a candidate has a six-month or one-year gap in her research output, and then a slow period afterward as she gets back up to speed and learns to balance her work and family, it's hard to imagine that won't hurt her career, no matter what explanation is attached in her file.  And God forbid she should want to have &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; children!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So this is a kind of sexism that's not based on any one person's behavior, but on the structure and norms of the community.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(Disclaimer: I am a childless man and have no personal experience with this issue, but I thought someone should mention it.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

She founded a self-help group at the university which is well established and has several dozen members. She does it almost by herself in her leisure time after university and sideline. She herself is not handicapped but has therapies running, but nothing which speaks against working regularly. On the one hand she could point out that she has a high level of soft skills and does a lot work voluntarily. But the problem then is how would an employer react about these facts? Wouldn't he think she has problems herself and therefore isn't a suitable candidate?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think it isn't good either to mention only vague information about this.

Furthermore, it sounds like your friend started a support group on her own initiative and successfully ran this group for some period of time with a fairly large number of person. This speaks to being a 'self-starter', and to good organizational and time-management skills, since she was doing this will completing her degree. The volunteering aspect is not as important as the other aspects, in my opinion since volunteering usually provides evidence of being motivated/'self-starter' which creating the group already emphasizes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My feeling would be that this is a good thing to mention as it highlights several desirable qualities. In my opinion, whether or not your friend has mental health issues is her own personal business and not that of potential employers, unless it requires special considerations, so I would advise her to describe this work without reference to her personal health situation, framing it in terms of interest rather than personal experience - i.e. her interest in mental health issues led her to create this group which she managed for a certain period of time with however many clients.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

In other words, don't try to save space in print unless you would use the same abbreviation in speech.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, I'm happy to say &quot;i.e.&quot; or &quot;e.g.&quot; orally in certain situations, so those abbreviations can be fine (indeed, it would sound really weird if you wrote &quot;id est&quot; or &quot;exempli gratia&quot;), but I would never refer to &quot;Sec. 5&quot; or &quot;Eq. 3&quot; when speaking.  Trying to pronounce &quot;Ch. 2&quot; as written would be even worse.  By this standard, abbreviations like NASA or FFT are OK, although they can of course be overused and they may be more cryptic than the writer intends.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This principle extends beyond abbreviations: try not to write anything that would be awkward to read aloud.  (For example, mathematicians sometimes violate this by juxtaposing formulas with no words in between them.)  Of course this is not an absolute rule, but following it will generally make your papers easier and more pleasant to read.

Peer review, as Dave Clarke mentions, is primarily how papers are scrutinized. But conference reviews are often on a severe time constraint. So for an experimental paper, the reviewer looks at the main ideas, sees if the experiments are convincing and handle the cases that the reviewer thinks are important, and evaluates the overall work for &quot;general excitement&quot;. But the reviewer has no ability to check if the work is correct. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In a theoretical paper, a reviewer might skim proofs, and see if the main claims pass a &quot;smell test&quot;. If the result is important, or surprising, the reviewer might try to verify key claims in detail, and expect the authors to argue why their techniques should work. But even there, no formal proof checking happens (that happens in the journal review). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, there are two (imperfect) safeguards against incorrect claims:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;author reputation - you don't want to get a rap for writing faulty papers&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;reproducibility - I might reproduce your work, or ask for your code, when writing my papers. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;">

If you've already thought about the proposed direction, obviously chip in any insights you might have, but if not, &quot;that's an interesting suggestion, and something I'd be interested in looking at in future work&quot; is all you really need to say.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are only a few realistic ways the Q&amp;amp;A session can go off of the rails.

In the end, it is okay to say, &quot;I don't know&quot; or to ask to discuss the question off-line, but the latter can seem like a bit of a cop-out. Try to answer the question, but only if the message is not getting through can you suggest to take it off-line.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But the real key is to practice your presentation extensively.

If markers will not/cannot give a mark higher than an A, A work will sometimes, because of noise be marked as A-, but never marked as A+ (since the A+ mark doesn't exist). Similarly, F work will sometimes be marked as D- but never as F- (again assuming F is the lowest mark).

The point here is clearly not to catch every mistake a marker might make but rather to check for signs of abuse of power. Because everyone marking knows that &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; of their marks will be checked by another is supposed to keep the original marker from giving inappropriately high or low grades to any students, since the marker does not know which of the marks will be checked (admins actually do the selection of the sample).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've worked at other universities where all work is double marked and in this case my experience is similar to Peter Jansson's.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Again, as I see it, the purpose of double marking (whether full or sampling) is to simply make sure that the student is getting marked fairly.

I am sure details will differ depending on how the system of two graders are set up. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the system I experienced it is a custom to have the course responsible plus someone external (in my case even from a different country) do the grading. The grading was completed by having a discussion between the two graders about possible deviations. In the system grades are given as a number between one and six in steps of 0.1, so very detailed. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My experience was actually quite remarkable; it concerned a masters/PhD level course. We were most often within 0.2 of each other except in one case (answer) where one had given a 1 and the other a 6. In that case it turned out the question was ambiguous and could be interpreted in different ways. The grades were basically calculated as the average of both but only after we had discussed the problems/deviations. This is, for example, how we discovered the ambiguous question formulation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From this, albeit miniscule, experience, I felt that the benefit of having two persons grading is that ambiguities in terms of questions and answers can be sorted out. It is also possible to discuss the apropriateness of the interpretations of answers given by students. The method also provides what I can call &quot;legal certainty&quot; since the grades will be based on two persons view rather than one. Of course the degree to which it is certian depends on the transparency of the process and to what extent the two gradings become official. The point in &quot;my&quot; case is that both graders have to agree so it is not signed by just one person. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a grader I also appreciated the possibility to discuss the grading and the corrections jointly made were fair and made the process worth while. I would personally like ot see the system used more, but fear it will be difficult from a financial point of view in many universities (-y systems).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

We all learn and maintain our skills in our own unique way.  Especially in industry or when operating independently, so it's difficult to say what would work for you.  I'm in a similar situation except that I'm a developer first and I've been tasked with 'just making security happen'.   Much like with you and bio-med, there is an awful lot that is changing in the landscape of info-sec and staying sharp in both domains is a real challenge.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That said; your mileage will vary but here are some techniques that work for me. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find overlapping areas:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;When I started to move toward developing a new aspect of my skill set I looked for areas where the old and the new overlap.  Luckily for me; this was a pretty easy thing to do with infosec and software development.  The benefit here is that it allows you to leverage your existing skills in a new area.  If can can find areas where you can turn two jobs into one you can ease your way into it, rather than just sitting down one weekend and deciding &quot;I'm going to learn X.&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sit down one weekend and decide &quot;I'm going to learn X.&quot;:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;Sometimes there is no easy overlap to ease your way into a new tech or topic. In those cases I've found that a couple of days in power study mode can be a real benefit.  Strap on the headphones, coffee up it that's your thing, and just read the literature &amp;amp; work problems.  If it's tech then do tutorials.  If it's topic then vacuum up as much as you can.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find mentors:&lt;/strong&gt; Maybe you can't find the all encompassing guru of everything you want to do, but that's OK.  Someday that guru will be you.  In the meantime find people with expertise in your subject areas to help you fill in the gaps. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep it fun:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;If at all possible and whenever possible. If you hate what you're doing then you're not going to do it well. At least that has been my experience. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't give in to the temptation to 'dumb it down':&lt;/strong&gt;  You're a smart person.  You've taken the time to learn a new skill. You've actually read the materials.  You work hard to develop and maintain a system that crosses a number of subject matter domains.  Don't let people off easy when they ask hard questions; give them hard answers.  My approach is to ask them 'do you want an answer or a response?'  If all they want is a response that's OK. I give them a short and succinct response.  If they want an answer then I do my best to provide the most exhaustive and thorough explanation of what I do, that I can.  When I work hard to learn a new skill I don't need to show it off but I won't let it be taken for granted either. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, that's what I've got. All the best to you in your endeavors. If you ever need Java help feel free to grab me on chat and I'll get you an email address. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

<answer QuestionId="Should your PhD students call you by your first name" AnswerId="lWWUAnfBrXYN9tH1kbCgYg==" Author="7357" Date="2013-06-19T10:54:48.053" Score="9" Text="&lt;p&gt;I recall a teacher of mine saying : &quot;Dealing with different cultures is dealing with different expectations&quot;, and calling someone by his title or his first name is definitely related to customs. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Being a French (from Chinese parents) student myself, I have never called my teachers/professors by their first names, but things tend to change just as customs evolve. Maybe it is because of my chinese backgrounds, which implies a strong use of titles (even for family members) that is explained by the importance of respect for the elders in the society.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then I got to study in Oslo for a few months, and people explicitly asekd me to call them by their first names, which I did later. However, it still feels akward for me to call someone by his first name when he is &quot;much&quot; more older than me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now what I do is that I say &quot;Monsieur&quot; or &quot;Madame&quot;, and use the first name if I am invited to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

Also I think it is a bad idea for researchers to be overly formal and deferential towards their supervisors; if you ware working at the cutting edge of your subject, not all of your ideas will be good ones, and the PhD student should feel comfortable pointing out where they feel this is the case.  This sort of self-skepticism (being comfortable with the idea of being wrong occasionally) is a key component of being a good scientist, and it seems to me to be difficult to communicate this by example if the student is constantly reminded of their place in the hierarchy by making them call me &quot;Dr Marsupial&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

The certificate also limits the hours that the student may work to 8 hours in a day and no more than 20 hours a week when school is in session and 40 hours when school is out, and requires the employer to follow all child labor laws. Once students graduate or leave school for good, they must be paid at least the federal minimum wage.&#xA;  There are some limitations on the use of the full-time student program...&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;">

There is, in principle, no &lt;em&gt;law&lt;/em&gt; stating that students can only work 20 hours per week when school is in session. In fact, it's quite the opposite—students can work as many hours as they would like. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; possible for universities to place conditions on financial aid recipients that they not work more than some number of hours per week, and in general it's not really that smart of an idea to be studying full-time and working full-time on top of that. And the university may also have limits on what students can do with on-campus student aide positions, whether or not they are on financial aid.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But as far as the US government is concerned?

Publishing is (at least theoretically) still done on print, so there is simply no way to change the physical journal once it has been sent to university libraries all over the world. Even for more important issues such as plagiarism or factually incorrect data, only an errata is issued, or the paper is marked as &quot;retracted&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What you can do instead is advertising the double name on your webpage and CV, and ensuring that the academic databases (such as Web of Science and Scopus) correctly recognize and handle your name change, marking all of your papers as written by a single author. You will probably need to notify them using the &quot;contact us&quot; functions on their websites.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Several authors in the same situation choose to keep the old name also on new papers; this makes it simpler for other researchers to recognize you, at the price of using a name that you might have disowned and now consider a relic from the past. In practice, there is no requirement that your academical &lt;em&gt;nom de plume&lt;/em&gt; coincides with the one that is written on your ID and that you use on legal papers, so you are free to sign your papers using a different version of it. Once you choose this route, however, it will be more practical if you consistently use the old name also when attending conferences.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are simply getting married, then signing your papers with both surnames is probably the easiest option. (I realize that probably you have already considered and discarded this option, but I thought it more appropriate to include it in my answer anyway.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

It's hard to say exactly what would make my department &quot;better&quot;, but to be somewhat vague, I would consider research productivity and funding to be important factors to improve on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's not much you can do as an undergraduate to help improve research productivity or funding.  It's not clear whether the department wants to improve in these ways, or should want to: there's nothing wrong with focusing on teaching.  Even if the faculty do want to become more research active, or the administration wants them to, it's not easy and there's little you can do to make it easier.  I'd be careful with how you frame things, since you could easily cause hurt feelings by giving your professors the impression that you consider them substandard.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Instead of focusing on what might improve the department in some abstract sense, I'd focus on what would create a stimulating, exciting environment for the current students.  You don't want to be too demanding, and some things just might not be feasible, but it can't hurt to ask what could be possible and what it would take to make it happen.  You could look into various sorts of activities:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advanced courses or independent study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Undergraduate research supervised by faculty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Informal mathematical activities: math club, Mathematical Association of America student chapter, Putnam team, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If all of these things are regularly available, then your department is doing pretty well.  Otherwise, you could try to initiate or reinvigorate some of them.  You aren't likely to get clubs or courses for just one student, so you'll probably have to gather some other enthusiastic students.  This may be the biggest way you could contribute, as a catalyst to bring together a group of students the department hadn't realized wanted or needed these activities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

I had gotten interested in numerical analysis in that time and so I had applied to my current PhD program. I have been under my adviser for 3 years now (the first year at my university is spent in coursework).  A PhD at my university is usually 5 years long. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Right now, I have &lt;strong&gt;almost nothing&lt;/strong&gt; to report in the way of research, and consequently no publications , no conference submissions. I am getting increasingly nervous and frustrated about whether or not I will make it, &lt;strong&gt;even&lt;/strong&gt; if I give myself an extra year by funding myself. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My adviser has consistently been making me work on uninteresting stuff, where most of the work involved is purely technical like writing brain-dead code, with almost zero chance for innovation. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BREAKDOWN OF MY PHD&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After monkeying around reading research papers, in the &lt;strong&gt;first year&lt;/strong&gt; under my adviser,  he got very confident about getting an industrial project and got me working on that, in anticipation that the contract would go through. At the end of the year we found out that we did not get the project.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;strong&gt;second year&lt;/strong&gt;, he said he wanted to get into GPU parallel computing &#xA;and to implement a few fluid dynamics algorithms. I slogged over many manuals, spent months and months writing and debugging code, all the time thinking that &#xA;this would be used to do some simulations he was interested in and get them published. But at the end of the second year my professor completely lost interest in these numerical techniques he was making my implement. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Seeing this schizophrenic attitude, I almost wanted to quit then and there itself. But I decided to just stick it out, thinking it might be 'just a phase'.  Due to funding issues, he once more got me working in the &lt;strong&gt;third year&lt;/strong&gt; on another project which essentially involved writing a lot of stupid code, and running endless benchmark tests.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have basically ended up trying to do a PhD in mathematics without any mathematics in this PhD. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, a couple of weeks back, I told him that I had had enough, and to give me some actual &#xA;problems/material to work with. After about an hour of discussion, and informing him that I was ready to fund my self if required, he finally gave me a couple of possible starting points for what I hope would actually turn out to be worthwhile research.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MY QUESTIONS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I do realize it was &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; foolish waiting for so long before putting my foot down, and not having the courage to speak up before. My adviser is well-regarded by colleagues in his field, and maybe I was subconsciously scared of &#xA;contradicting his handling of my PhD for pissing him off. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But even though he has now suggested problems which do seem interesting, after having had so many negative experiences  I am very skeptical about the future. How should I proceed, and what are the factors I should consider ? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Frankly, I am feeling very burned out.  In the way of future plans, I have been toying with the idea of dropping out,  getting a break for a few months and then sitting for some entrance exams for a Masters in Economics in some good universities back in my home country. I always found economics very interesting through my undergrad and more so these past few-months while studying it has a hobby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continuing would require me to stay on for an extra year till August 2015, &#xA;which leaves me &lt;strong&gt;about 17 months tops&lt;/strong&gt; from now, before I start hunting in academic job market. This includes about 2-3 months I will have to spend doing literature review on the proposed topics and learning the requisite mathematical tools. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So if I decide to stay on, how should I re-structure my study/research time and the relationship with my adviser in these 17 months so that I can make some head-way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Maybe 17 months is too short a time? Any suggestions would be really helpful !!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

That way it serves to rejuvenate your mind and gives you a breather. By doing so you can hit three birds with one stone: 1) you take a break and feel better 2) you have some money to use 3) you become more interested in other subjects you never thought you would have liked, such as technology, fashion, the business world, different languages and culture, etc. I didn't say to quit, I said to take some time off and &quot;find yourself, to rediscover yourself&quot;. Will it help? Maybe or maybe not. Perhaps if you look at yourself in comparison to the rest of the world. You're doing a PhD which is one of the most prestigious and most sought after degree in the world. Not many people are able to do that let alone get a bachelor degree. Be grateful. Some people don't even have enough money to afford a days meal or a roof over their head. Hell be lucky you're not in combat or war. Sometimes it helps to appreciate with what you have. That may give you motivation to keep going. Maybe PhD isn't for you. Maybe it is for you. maybe you're meant to become the next Bill Gates or the next president. Who knows. My point is no matter what happens always keep your head up, stay confident, and don't ever give up. Take a break. But don't give up. No don't worry you are not alone. The fact that you made it this far shows you are a winner (Charlie Sheen haha just kidding). Don't give up doc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

For instance, how many students who earn a college degree graduate one, two, three, or more years earlier than the typical age of 22 or so? I am willing for any statistics to qualified in any way (percentages in country W, at university X, in state Y, or from year Z). A quick Google search does not easily reveal this information.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I estimate that less than 5% of the population graduates college two years earlier than normal based on my acquaintances, but this is likely biased as I am a graduate student and it may be smaller.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;EDIT: It occurs to me that my question does not ask for any opinions on whether early graduation is good, neutral, or bad.

I think the biggest concern that people have is that skipping grades can be socially awkward, but I actually skipped largely for social reasons: I was splitting my time between two grades with different schedules, and when I moved, I just decided to take all my classes in the same grade (my school agreed). The other thing is that you spend _years_ getting used to being younger than everyone else, so when you get to college, it's not that much different.

Most of the time, my age was not an issue socially. I was also an RA (residential advisor), so my age was not assumed to correlate with lack of leadership ability. Academically, it might have even helped me get certain positions, because I was seen as a &quot;driven&quot; individual with prior academic success, and all of those positions helped me get into graduate school. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now that I'm in graduate school, the only thing I really miss is not having interesting stories to tell about cool things I did during my gap year(s). That problem is common to a lot of people in my class, though, regardless of them being a few years older than me. I don't have people that are my age in my year, but I don't think it's affected my academic success here: I've had four years of high school, four years of undergrad, and three summers of undergraduate research, like (or better than) many of my peers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

In many cases it is actually considered an advantage, since you can import your skills, expertise and a certain thought-process into a field in which many people do not have those skills. For example, many physicists, computer scientists and mathematicians have migrated to biology and have made significant contributions. In fact, there are even postdoctoral fellowships that specifically fund this type of field-change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding your &quot;will they take me seriously&quot; questions: Since you are aiming mostly at applied ML/stats, I don't think you should be too concerned if the ML/stats theoretical community take you seriously. Many theorists tend to look down on applied science - don't worry about it, you can still have a significant impact without advancing any theory. It sounds like in the future you will either belong to the department in which you want to apply the techniques (e.g. a biology department) or will work very closely with people in those departments. In this case, you will usually be considered the ML/stats expert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having said all that, of course it is your job to become an expert. Teaching yourself the theory is important, but if you are going for applied science, especially applied ML/stats, it would be a big advantage to get actual experience in using them. There is a huge difference between learning about these methods and actually implementing and using them. You will see that during your PhD you can often expand your research in directions you are more interested in. It shouldn't be too difficult to use some ML/stats creatively in some sub-projects (which could later be expanded).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;">

I would suggest you get a list of supervisors and then check their backgrounds, to ensure they have the necessary skills.

It seems harsh my opinion, but it seems that way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The only solution is to tell the truth to the Dean and for what I know, the penalty will come sooner or later.

This is more straightforward and predictable than dealing with the thesis itself.  If the plagiarism is confined to background material, then I don't think retracting the papers would be necessary.  Instead, I expect it would be possible to publish a correction that indicates the plagiarized portions and provides citations.  This would be embarrassing and would hurt her reputation a little, but it would solve the problem as far as the papers were concerned.  It would also strengthen the student's case for dealing with the thesis if she can say she voluntarily corrected the publications and did not need to retract any of them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If none of the plagiarized material was published elsewhere, then it's trickier.  Once all the original results are published in research papers, I doubt anyone will read the thesis and discover the plagiarism.  Even if they do, they might take pity on the student and ignore the plagiarism.  (I once ignored some mild plagiarism of my writing in the background sections of a thesis at another university.  The student had already graduated, and I found no evidence of plagiarism in any of his research papers.  If I knew for sure he could just file a correction to the thesis, then that would make sense, but I wouldn't want to potentially destroy his career over this mistake.)  So she might well get away with it if she doesn't say anything.  Still, I'd advise her to officially confess to the university.  Turning herself in is likely to lead to a &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; better outcome than being caught by someone else.  Plus it's the right thing to do, and it will save her from years of worrying about getting caught.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;We both risk losing our jobs, and she is at risk of losing her degree as well (which, by the way, was a very strong thesis with a good number of top journal publications). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unless your university is extraordinarily strict, I don't think your job is in jeopardy.  On the other hand, the student's degree or job might be, depending on how the university handles the situation.  Based on your description, I think it would be unfair for her career to be ruined, but I can't predict what will actually happen.  I hope your administration's sense of fairness is the same as mine, in which case a correction will suffice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The hardest situation will be if she decides to remain silent.  In that case you probably have an obligation to turn her in, and it would look terrible if anyone found out that you knew but didn't say anything.  On the other hand, turning her in would be a tough decision.  Much better for her to turn herself in voluntarily.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

Providing a reference and then long string of text implies that the text is YOUR description of ideas of someone ELSE. To give full credit to someone else requires some sort of formatting distinction (typically block indentation or quotation makes). Potentially the plagiarism was accidental, but it is still plagiarism.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supervisor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A doctoral dissertation is generally a single author piece of independent work. Plagiarism in a dissertation should have little direct impact on the career of the supervisor. It might have some indirect consequences like people questioning how you can be so unfamiliar with your students work that you do not catch plagiarism, but I think most people would be pretty understanding about this. If the thesis was not single author or if the work was published with your name on it, that is a different story since co-authorship implies you have BOTH plagiarized.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Failure to report academic misconducted (whether it is your student or not) can impact your career. At my university we do not classify failure of a student to report academic misconducted of another student as academic misconducted. I don't know the disciplinary process when faculty are involved. Personally, I would say that we all have a responsibility to the scientific process to report ALL cases of academic misconduct that we are aware of.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At my University, the penalty for plagiarism by a current student is zero on the piece of work. This would mean the student would have failed her dissertation. As a department we would deem this penalty too severe and push that she would be able to re-submit a new dissertation that reuses the non-plagiarized material. The University would push back and ask for a completely independent dissertation. I have never experienced this with a PhD student, but this occurs regularly with our final year undergraduates and about 70% of the time the student is allowed to reuse the non-plagiarized material.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't know what would happen if the plagiarism was found after the degree was given. My guess is the University would have to retract the dissertation from the library and any electronic database. They may revoke the degree, but they could also look at other work and count those towards the dissertation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The current university may try and fire or penalize her, but this seems harsh compared to the typical penalty of plagiarism in a dissertation of not getting/delaying a degree.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

An easy way , in Computer Science, is setting alerts (both on Arxiv and Google Scholar) and following pioneers in your area. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a personal experience, I spent plenty of time gathering, reading and understanding related papers/books. I came across many interesting ideas. But finally, I found some of my ideas are published in others papers. Some were exactly the same! This is the curse of PhD. Try to publish before others as long as you have the required knowledge and a clear contribution.  The literature is then translated to the cumulative process of publishing different papers related to your thesis problem.  You stop when you do the defence (assuming you will change the area thereafter).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

This process should continue as long as you are working in the field of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, from a practical standpoint, you do need to select a cutoff. There should be a reasonable point in time in which you've set the outline of the review, and decided on the main topics and questions to be discussed. At that point, it would be fair to set aside adding more references, and stick to what's been published. However, you should continue to monitor the field, and if further revisions or updates of the text are necessary, then you should include the papers published in the interim as part of your updates.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

The issue of different terminology is especially troublesome because you cannot search for consistent keywords. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless this is an important metric. In mathematics you typically cannot point to real-world applications (any way, that is not the kind of importance you necessarily want for your paper). But it can provide context that the problem you are studying has been analyzed before, it gives you some other results that you can compare your paper to, and so on.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

This is because there is a large grey-zone between work published in established journals and work &quot;published&quot; in more &quot;questionable&quot; sources. Obviously the way to obtain a number would be to use search services such as Web of Science, Scopus etc. or reference data bases. But, for example, Web of Science only covers works published in ISI listed journals or papers referenced by ISI listed papers and on top of that only back in time for as long as journals have submitted reference information. This means such searches will be incomplete. Hence to arrive at a number may require quite a bit of work unless one would state the limitations imposed on a search sich as limting it to Web of science.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The choice of key word(s) will also be important and it is not certain keywords are systematically applied between sources or over time. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A claim to have found &quot;all&quot; literature is very questionable and I would argue that when one makes such a claim one must provide a picture of the limitations of the search because there will certainly always be such limitations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;">

Since the comments are anonymous and the web site is not run by the university, there's no way to enforce anything even if you established a policy like &quot;students mustn't submit unfair comments&quot; or &quot;offensive comments must be removed at the request of the lecturer&quot;.  You can write a complaint letter to the site or even sue them for libel without needing an institutional policy to back you up, and I'm not sure what the other options are./>

When the sites first appeared in the U.S. about ten years ago, questions came up about whether anything could be done about it, and the institution I was associated with then decided that there wasn't anything legal that could be done.  I believe that libelous material can be appealed directly through some of the websites, but I've never heard of anyone having success with that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Personally, I love anonymous feedback, and I've had my share of good and bad reviews.  I've tried to use the bad reviews as a means for informing where I can improve, and I've tried to limit my head from getting too big at the good reviews.
